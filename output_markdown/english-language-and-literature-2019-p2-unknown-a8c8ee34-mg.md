## SECTION A

### Question 1 [32 marks] (Poetry: poetic and stylistic analysis)

**Explore how Blake presents ideas about faith and hope in ‘The Chimney Sweeper (I)’**

> **Marker instruction:** A response that does not address any one of the three assessment objectives targeted (AO1, AO2, AO3, AO4) cannot achieve all of the marks in the given level.

- Voice: 1st person past tense narrative, moving to continuous present tense in the final stanza. Reported speech in the second stanza.
- Form, structure: Dramatic monologue of 6 quatrains of 10 or 11 syllables, with a strong stress on the final syllable. Occasional enjambment between lines (stanzas 2, 4 and 6). Extended sentence between 3 and 4 stanza, containing the volta which contrasts the misery of the children with the sustaining hope of the dream.
- Imagery and symbolism: Sharp contrast between daily misery of work and the dream ‘heaven’ where childhood can be briefly recovered – provided Tom is a ‘good boy’. Christian symbolism linking Tom Dacre to a ‘lamb’, strongly suggesting innocence and purity; also cleansing, cleanliness through washing away of literal and ‘spiritual’ dirt. An angel frees the children, possibly ironically symbolising the established church and the lack of practical aid offered on earth. Metaphor of ‘lock’d up in coffins of black’ for chimney (sweeping) emphasises the dark, dangerous and claustrophobic nature of the work.
- Rhyme and rhythm: Anapestic rhyming couplets, lines vary between 8-12 syllables, emphasising child-like voice. Third lines of stanzas 2-6 are 10 or 11 syllables. ‘Sermonising’ effect suggests repetition of empty or unverified promises which only bring temporary comfort.
- Lexis: Words associated with Christian faith, innocence, unhappiness, suffering, dirt, despair, child labour, work, escape, freedom, cleanliness, countryside, hope, faith.
- Grammar and morphology: Near past tense, shifting to continuous present tense in the final stanza as the boys wake and resume work. Characteristic childlike simple syntax. Relatively controlled sentences throughout, frequent use of commas within and at end of lines. Stanza 2 is one long sentence. 1 extended sentence links stanzas 3 and 4, containing the volta. Contracted verbs in stanzas 2, 3 and 4. Sibilance is prominent in the first half.
- Context (AO3): One of the darker ‘Innocence’ poems, ‘The Chimney Sweeper’ suggests that innocence will always be tainted by ‘real world’ experience. The heavenly ‘rural idyll’ which is a feature of many of the poems is but a dream and thus unobtainable.
- Context (AO3): The poem highlights the issue of child labour, abuse and exploitation and the apparent hopelessness of their plight. The established church is also criticised for espousing blind faith in the hope of a better (after) life but offering little practical aid to the poor and needy.
- Connections (AO4): ‘The Chimney Sweeper (E)’ and ‘London (E)’ and ‘The Nurse’s Song (I)’ may offer particular similarities and contrasts about how ideas of faith and hope are presented.

### Question 2 [32 marks]

**Explore how Dickinson presents ideas and feelings about striving for freedom in ‘The Soul has Bandaged Moments (512)’**

- Voice and Tone: Continuous present tense, 3rd person description of the intense experience of bursting free from restraint; the aftermath of this is addressed in stanza 5 and the last two lines.
- Form, Structure and Graphology: 5 stanzas and ‘a half’. The last two lines graphically suggest the soul’s reimprisonment, cutting it off from any hope of further escape. Characteristic incomplete, fragmented sentence and use of hyphens to denote clauses, along with Dickinson’s regular use of 4/3/4/3 hymn meter. Elongation of stanza 2 suggests her paralysis and balances the truncated stanza 6.
- Imagery and Symbolism: Ambiguity of ‘bandaged’, suggesting healing, restraint or death (e.g. Egyptian mummies). Gothic overtones through ‘the Horror’, the ‘Fright’ and ‘Goblin’. Inability to move contrasted with the equally destructive energy of escape: ‘burst’, ‘danced like a bomb’. Analogy of the bee and the rose: the rose is beloved by the bee and can’t escape it; she can’t escape the lover or ‘Horror’. The excessive intensity of escape leads to recapture and imprisonment: the soul is personified as a ‘felon’ and a ‘shackled’ bird whose song has been cut off, contrasting with ‘brayed’.
- Rhyme and Rhythm: Characteristic use of slant rhymes in 2nd/4th lines, repeated throughout, ending with a half rhyme in the final two lines suggesting unfinished/ongoing cycle of restraint and escape. Unusual internal rhyme in final lines of stanza 2 (mean/theme) disrupts the rhythm, breaking her paralysis and anticipating the escape.
- Lexis: Imprisonment, entrapment, restraint, escape, release, liberty, nature, crime, guilt, the Gothic, supernatural, terror, love, emotion, destruction.
- Grammar and Morphology: 1 unfinished sentence, characteristically punctuated with hyphens, which serve to separate and emphasise the images, forcing re-evaluation. Occasional use of commas to emphasise the horror of the Goblin (stanza 2) her liberty ‘abroad’ (stanza 3) and recapture and restriction in stanza 5.
- Context (AO3): One of several poems which explore the culturally passive role of women in society.
- Context (AO3): Use of hymn meter to explore inequality in relationships and the expected submissiveness of women; the influence of Gothic literature is evident.
- Connections (AO4): ‘My Life had stood – a Loaded Gun’ (754) and ‘One Need not be a Chamber – to be Haunted’ (670).

### Question 3 [32 marks]

**Explore how Heaney presents childhood memories and discoveries in ‘Death of a Naturalist’.**

- Voice and Tone: 1st person narration of childhood memory from adult perspective. Child’s voice evident when recounting what ‘Miss Wall’ said, contrasting with increasing menace in stanza 2, articulated through ‘adult’ complex constructs.
- Form: 2 stanzas, blank verse contrasting childish wonder of the natural world with adult recollection of the angry frogs. Some enjambment, particularly in second half of stanza 1, suggesting enthusiasm. The extremely uneven share line between stanzas (2/8) signals the volta: abrupt break between comforting childhood ritual/memory and frightening encounter with the adult frogs.
- Imagery and Symbolism: Vivid evocation of unappealing aspects of natural world (ugly, oppressive, smelly) contrasts with range of wildlife/insects found there and childhood enthusiasm. Contrast between scale of the flax dam ‘weighed down’ and delicacy of the bubbles. Contrast between childhood excitement/enthusiasm and the menace of the adult frogs: Childishness of ‘Mammy frog’ suggest relatively young age of the narrator. Similes/metaphors used to convey threat of attack e.g. ’pulsed like sails’ and ‘mud grenades’. Subversion of sound to convey revulsion – ‘croaking’ becomes ‘farting’.
- Rhyme and Rhythm: Blank verse, unrhymed, mostly iambic pentameter. Occasional alliteration and anaphora used for emphasis e.g. ‘wait and watch’ (anticipation) or ‘Some hopped…some sat’ (building threat).
- Lexis: Words associated with nature, insects, wildlife, frogs, tadpoles, plants, reproduction, childhood, school, memories, fear, escape threat, attack, military, sound, singing.
- Grammar and Morphology: Characteristic long, controlled sentences. Past tense, some use of the first personal pronoun. Relatively long sentences in stanza one with little internal punctuation suggesting childhood enthusiasm. Stanza 2 is tighter, underscoring the threat/narrator’s fear. Rule of 3 verb list in line 31 intensifies the revolted, fearful reaction, simultaneously disrupting the iambic rhythm.
- Context (AO3): one of several explorations of childhood memory.
- Context (AO3): Irish poetry dwelling on the relationships of people with the landscape and their place within it.
- Connections (AO4): ‘Churning Day’, and ‘The Toome Road’.

### Question 4 [32 marks]

**Explore how Boland presents ideas and attitudes towards the rituals of household work in ‘Woman in Kitchen’.**

- Voice: 3rd person narrative in the continuous present tense, suggesting detachment and emphasising the indifference of the appliances and the speaker’s limited, disenfranchised role.
- Form: 4 stanzas of six lines of 8-12 syllables. Variable sentence lengths, most. Some enjambment in stanzas 2, 3 and 4.
- Imagery and Symbolism: Repetition of ‘white’ creates an enclosed, clinical setting, and emphasises the automated processes. She is surrounded by machines: ‘jigsaw’ suggests ‘fitting together’ but it is also a precision tool. Striking metaphors of life in the outside world in stanza 3 contrast sharply with the setting. Dichotomy between the purposeful actions of the machines and the apparent redundancy of the woman. Imagery of death: personification of ‘silence’ actively ‘buries’ the room which becomes as quiet as a 'morgue'. Contrast between the noise made by the machines and the quiet in which the woman is able to work.
- Rhyme and Rhythm: Variable rhyme scheme. Metre moves between iambs and trochees. The weak stress always falls on ‘she’, subordinating her to the machines. Internal rhyme in the final line.
- Lexis: work, chores, kitchen appliances, colour, clinical, death, blindness, space, enclosure, travel, furniture, crockery, sounds.
- Grammar and Morphology: Continuous present tense with variable sentence lengths. Contrast between tightly controlled sentences in stanza 1 and longer sentences in second half of stanza 3 and 4. Use of third person feminine pronoun to characterise the woman. Repetition of ‘white’ in stanza 2 and asyndeton in stanza 3. Statements to describe the machines in stanza 3, the first of which lacks a verb. (‘Round lunar window’)
- Context (AO3): One of several poems in the collection which explores the lives and roles of women.
- Context (AO3): This fits into a wider tradition of poems which explore the customs and rituals of household work, particularly those linked with the traditional role of the female or mother figure.
- Connections (AO4): ‘Degas’s Laundresses’ and ‘Painting Back from Market by Chardin’.

### Question 5 [32 marks]

**Explore how Duffy presents ideas and feelings about love and the natural world in ‘Write’.**

- Voice: 1st person exploration of love and its intensely imagined interaction with the natural world. Continuous near past tense. Imperatives used to command the documentation the images.
- Form: 3 stanzas of varying lengths. Shared, indented lines between stanzas suggests paragraphs, reflecting the title. Variable line lengths, 8-11 syllables. Extended, but fewer lines in stanza 2 suggests the river sandwiched between the landscapes depicted in stanzas 1 and 3. Some enjambment, most prominently in stanzas 1 and 3. Final hemistich emphasises symbolic death.
- Imagery and Symbolism: Each stanza imagines becoming one with the elements, even being symbolically consumed by them, reflecting emotional intensity. The elements are personified as contrasting ‘characters’, most notably the river as a lover and the moon and stars as a thuggish mob. Suggestion of purification through fire and water.
- Rhyme, Rhythm, phonology: No rhyme scheme, some half rhymes, implicit in stanza 1. Trochees and repetition create increasing urgency throughout.
- Lexis: Words associated with love, loving, kissing, passionate encounters, weddings, sex, sun, heat, water, cold, night, moon and stars death, burial, burning and purification.
- Grammar and Morphology: Stanza 1 and 2 are one sentence long, stanza 3 has two sentences; all have variable clause lengths. Continuous past tense which falters in the final sentence, moving from the present tense for the instruction to the past tense for the marriage description. Imperatives evident throughout (‘write’). Repetition of ‘love’ in stanza 2 simulates the ‘glug’ of drowning. Use of first and second pronouns to distinguish between the person instructed to ‘write’ and the first person experience.
- Context (AO3): One poem in a collection tracing the development and ending of a love affair.
- Context (AO3): This fits in with a wider tradition and literary heritage which connects the intensity of love with the energies of the natural world and also perceives love as a form of death.
- Connections (AO4): ‘Answer’ and ‘Love’

### Question 6 [32 marks]

**Explore how Sam-La Rose presents ideas and feelings about the experience and impact of music.**

- Voice: 1st person fragmented narrative, continuous present tense.
- Form: 12 stanzas of 2 or 3 lines, one extended, fragmented sentence. No punctuation, but mis-en-page denotes clauses. Varying lengths, mostly 12-15 syllables, contracting to 7 in stanza 10, and shortening further in the last two stanzas.
- Imagery and Symbolism: Power of the primal experience: ‘stripped down’, ‘beat and bone’. The intense musical experience is depicted as a religious or ‘rite of passage’ practice: the imperative ‘let the music fill the empty spaces’ suggests immersion and subsequent personification of music with its ‘wing-beats’ implies an angelic or spiritual presence. Contrast between the intense build up and release and the enervated, ‘weighted down recovery the next morning.
- Rhyme and Rhythm: No rhyme scheme, occasional internal rhyme (e.g. ‘wads and scads’). Shortening clauses and monosyllabic words increase pace and intensity through stanzas 5-8. Alliteration and sibilance intensifies the beat. The imperative ‘Let the music fill the empty spaces’ is central, heralding the most intense section. ‘Released’ at the end of stanza 8 is followed by lengthening clauses through the remaining stanzas, signalling the subsequent morning recovery.
- Lexis: Words associated with: music, dancing, clubbing, concerts, gigs, rite of passage, religion, spirituality conflict, exercise, sweat, food, water, emotion, intensity, urban landscapes.
- Grammar and Morphology: Continuous present tense. No punctuation exception for a contractual apostrophe. Disjointed statements. Repetition of ‘this is the year’ emphasising significance of the memory. Imperative use of ‘let’ in stanza 6. Some delayed verbs.
- Context (AO3): a poem from a collection called ‘Breaking Silence’ which explores the experiences of fitting in and finding a voice in society.
- Context (AO3): the poem fits into a literary tradition which explores the role of music in society, particularly as a unifier or as a means of expressing allegiance or identity.
- Connections (AO4): ‘Make some Noise’ and 'Speechless II'

## SECTION B

### Question 7 [32 marks] (Plays: dramatic and stylistic analysis)

### Question 10 [32 marks]

**Explore how Friel presents Owen in this extract from Translations.**

- Form and structure: the extract occurs at the end of Act 1 just after the arrival of the English soldiers. The motives for Owen/Rowland’s mis-translation of Lancey, and where his loyalties lie, are not yet clear. The strikingly different English voices of Lancey and Yolland evident here – the abrupt, authoritarian and condescending assertions of Lancey versus the hesitant diffidence of Yolland, both contrasting with the straightforwardness of Owen’s voice, temporarily ameliorating the threat from Lancey. The concluding confrontation between the brothers Owen and Manus, with Manus’ suggestion that Owen has previously shown the capacity for duplicity or manipulation, ‘It’s the same Owen’, foreshadows the destructive internecine conflicts of Act 3.
- Dramatic techniques: the inability of the two English characters to understand any of the languages spoken other than English (Irish and Latin) stands representative of their, and their country’s, levels of ignorance of the culture and education of the Baile Beag residents. Yolland’s respect and diffidence seems initially attractive, yet it his naivety and idealisation of Gaelic culture that is the catalyst for the tragic events that occur, ‘I hope we’re not too – too crude an intrusion on your lives’. Manus, hitherto seen as passive and powerless in the face of Hugh’s braggadocio, presented at the end of the scene as being more perceptive and a stronger defender of his community than previously suspected. Owen’s role as peacemaker, ironic given his position as Lancey’s agent. Owen’s assertion that Owen/Roland is ‘only a name’ is tragically challenged as the play progresses.
- Discourse: Conversation analysis e.g. Owen’s key role in ameliorating the threat implicit in Lancey’s statement evident in the statement/translation adjacency pairs; his subordinate role relative to Lancey inverted by his power of being the insider and polyglot. Lancey’s is the language of bureaucratic certitude while Owen’s hedges and softens. Yolland’s desire to interact hopelessly naive in light of Lancey’s statement of intent: hesitation, repetition and self-effacement from this reluctant colonialist, ‘sorry-sorry’, ‘I feel very foolish’. Cross cultural misunderstanding and mis-truth gives way to a shared understanding, albeit one characterised by conflict, between Owen/Manus via a shared language at the end of the scene.
- Lexis: the language of technological and colonial power and control ‘…triangulation…executed to a scale of six inches to the English mile’ from Lancey stripped out in Owen’s translation, ‘a new map’. Hugh’s language of the genial host ‘…friendship’ hospitality’ and every assistance…’ concealing for the moment his real feelings under the guise of not understanding English. Informal, colloquial, mildly taboo language of Owen/Manus ‘bloody ramrod’, ‘bloody military operation’, ‘you bastards’, suggesting intimacy and real emotions.
- Grammar and morphology: Complex declaratives from Lancey denoting his surety and obliviousness to the sensitivities of his audience. Interrogatives from Manus later as he seeks to interrogate Manus.
- Figurative language and rhetorical features: strong contrasts in register between Lancey, Yolland, Hugh and Owen. Owen’s ‘real’ voice emerges in duologue with Manus – a symmetry in language choices between the brothers hints perhaps at shared values.
- Context (AO3): the impact of the English intrusion into the seemingly timeless culture of Baile Beag dramatised here, yet it is the English desire to sentimentalise Ireland rather than the colonial intent to map the territory that is catalyst for the destruction of the community. The play is non-didactic in this regard, Maire’s desire to learn English is for her as legitimate a response ‘to mud cabins and a diet of potatoes’ as Hugh’s defence of the Irish language. The end of Act 1 here with the meeting of Maire and Yolland and their misplaced motives in commencing a relationship ultimately fractures the tense co-existence of England and Ireland and creates the context for tragedy.

### Question 11 [32 marks]

**Explore how Wertenbaker presents Mary and Dabby in this extract from Our Country’s Good.**

- Form and structure: From Act 1 Scene 8, a scene reflecting on female experiences and perspectives as Dabby and Mary prepare for a rehearsal; characteristic of the play’s form, in two acts, each of eleven short scenes, which group some of the twenty-two characters together, in differently focused interactions; structure and development e.g. a range of topics covered – Dabby’s homesickness develops into reflections of Mary’s guilt over her sexual experiences on the journey to Australia; concluding with a discussion and reading of ‘The Recruiting Officer’.
- Dramatic techniques: Stage directions and stage business e.g. play-within-a-play/meta-theatrical references, including the discussion and comparisons on acting and character and the reading from ‘The Recruiting Officer’; the lifting of Mary’s skirt suggesting Dabby’s intimate knowledge of Mary.
- Discourse: Types of utterance e.g. a private conversation; conversation analysis e.g. change in power and dominance from Dabby in the first half to Mary in the second; length of turns; largely co-operative exchange; Mary’s interruptions and attempts to change the topic away from sex and Dabby’s subsequent attempt to change topic away from her prostituting Mary; register and style of language e.g. informal, idiomatic register, contrasting with the formality of ‘The Recruiting Officer’; Dabby’s derisive laugh ‘ha’.
- Lexis: Lexical groups e.g. sex, religion, drama; significant word choices such as verb ‘drooling’, the contrasts between the nouns ‘whore’, ‘virgin’ and ‘martyr’; syndetic pair ‘brave and strong’; contrasts in Dabby/Mary’s and Farquhar’s use of language to describe sex.
- Grammar and morphology: Sentence types e.g. imperatives ‘Dabby, don’t!’, ‘Listen, my darling…’; frequent simple sentences to reflect naturalistic speech; Dabby’s shocking complex sentence ‘While you were with your little sailor…’; contrast in the syntax of the quoted play and the conversation.
- Figurative language and rhetorical features: Imagery e.g. ‘Devon rain is the softest in England’ as Dabby reflects on her home; patterning of similes ‘As soft as…’ contrasting with the horrors of their passage ‘biting like dogs’; patterning of ‘Men with…’; parallelism ‘That was different. That was love’; contrasting interpretations ‘whore’ and ‘martyr’; the symbolic role of language and the theatre.
- Context (AO3): The dramatic context in which this extract occurs within the play e.g. the rehearsals of the play; Ralph and Mary’s relationship; references to home, anticipating Dabby’s plans to escape.
- Context (AO3): Other relevant contexts e.g. attitudes towards women; religion; a developing female solidarity ‘We women have to look after each other’; Wertenbaker’s theatre work with prisoners; Keneally’s novel The Playmaker; the treatment of convicts.

### Question 12 [32 marks]

**Explore how Butterworth presents Johnny ‘Rooster’ Byron’s account of his birth in this extract from Jerusalem.**

- Form and structure: Towards the beginning of Act 2; one of a number of examples of Johnny’s storytelling; narrative structure; Johnny is performing before a relatively large group of friends; Ginger’s sceptical interjections.
- Dramatic techniques: Stage directions and stage business e.g. the throwing of the bullet; Johnny’s smiles; the comic, dramatic impact of Ginger’s disbelief.
- Discourse: Types of utterance e.g. Johnny’s highly expressive and engaging narrative style; conversation analysis e.g. Johnny’s extended turns and the others yielding the floor; Ginger’s interruption ‘Wait’; repeated questions as Ginger attempts to quiz Johnny’s account; register and style of language e.g. Johnny’s characteristically colloquial, informal register.
- Lexis: Taboo language and colloquialisms e.g. ‘lasses’, ‘slap-bang’, ‘beggars’, ‘Bollocks!’; repetition of ‘teeth’, ‘black’, ‘bullet’; lexical groups e.g. the body, violence; interesting verbs ‘zings’, ‘whooping’, ‘shake’ and the neologism ‘crepples’.
- Grammar and morphology: Sentence types e.g. frequent ellipsis and minor sentences to imitate spontaneous speech, ‘Loves the lasses’, ‘Thirty-two chompers’; non-standard grammar and syntax e.g. ‘hair on them’s chest’, ‘I jumps’, ‘He don’t’; Ginger’s interrogatives; present tense.
- Figurative language and rhetorical features: Johnny’s remarkable and suggestive figurative language e.g. metaphors ‘tracks the old goat’s scent’, ‘in the cheap seats’, ‘love bells’ and similes ‘like a wound’, ‘like a lump of granite’, ‘sharp as spears’; the associations of Byron boys with power/violence and a mythic England/the landscape.
- Context (AO3): The context in which the extract occurs in the play e.g. the relationship between Johnny and Ginger; dancing and revelry preceding the passage; Johnny establishing himself as a legendary and violent figure; one of many stories told in the play.
- Context (AO3): The context within the genre of drama e.g. mixing of realism and naturalistic dialogue with more magical and mythic ideas. Other relevant contexts e.g. an ‘origin’ myth; a modern version of a virgin birth.
