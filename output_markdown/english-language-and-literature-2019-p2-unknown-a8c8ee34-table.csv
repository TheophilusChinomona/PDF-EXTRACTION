When my mother died I was very young,
And my father sold me while yet my tongue,
Could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep.
So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep.

Theres little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head
That curl’d like a lambs back, was shav’d, so I said,
Hush Tom never mind it, for when your head’s bare,
You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.

And so he was quiet, & that very night,
As Tom was a sleeping he had such a sight,
That thousands of sweepers Dick, Joe, Ned & Jack
Were all of them lock’d up in coffins of black,

And by came an Angel who had a bright key,
And he open’d the coffins & set them all free.
Then down a green plain leaping laughing they run
And wash in a river and shine in the Sun.

Then naked & white, all their bags left behind,
They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind.
And the Angel told Tom, if he’d be a good boy,
He’d have God for his father & never want joy.

And so Tom awoke and we rose in the dark
And got with our bags & our brushes to work.
Tho’ the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm.
So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.",,,,,Explore how Blake presents ideas about faith and hope in ‘The Chimney Sweeper (I)’,"A response that does not address any one of the three assessment objectives targeted (AO1, AO2, AO3, AO4) cannot achieve all of the marks in the given level.","[""Voice: 1st person past tense narrative, moving to continuous present tense in the final stanza.

Perhaps you’re right. Well. What we are doing is this. (He looks at OWEN. OWEN nods reassuringly) His Majesty’s government has ordered the first ever comprehensive survey of this entire country – a general triangulation which will embrace detailed hydrographic and topographic information and which will be executed to a scale of six inches to the English mile.
Hugh: (Pouring a drink) Excellent – excellent.
(LANCEY looks at OWEN.)
Owen: A new map is being made of the whole country.
(LANCEY looks to OWEN: Is that all? OWEN smiles reassuringly and indicates to proceed.)
Lancey: This enormous task has been embarked on so that the military authorities will be equipped with up-to-date and accurate information on every corner of this part of the Empire.
Owen: The job is being done by soldiers because they are skilled in this work.
Lancey: And also so that the entire basis of land valuation can be reassessed for purposes of more equitable taxation.
Owen: This new map will take the place of the estate agent’s map so that from now on you will know exactly what is yours in law.
Lancey: In conclusion I wish to quote two brief extracts from the white paper which is our governing charter: (Reads) ‘All former surveys of Ireland resulted in forfeiture and violent transfer of property; the present survey has for its object the relief which can be afforded to the proprietors and occupiers of land from unequal taxation.
Owen: The captain hopes that the public will cooperate with the sappers and that the new map will mean that taxes are reduced.
Hugh: A worthy enterprise – opus honestum! And Extract B?
Lancey: ‘Ireland is privileged. No such survey is being undertaken in England. So this survey cannot but be received as proof of the disposition of this government to advance the interests of Ireland.’ My sentiments too.
Owen: The survey demonstrates the government’s interest in Ireland and the captain thanks you for listening so attentively to him.
Hugh: Our pleasure, Captain.
Lancey: Lieutenant Yolland?
Yolland: I - I - I have nothing to say – really-
Owen: The captain is the man who actually makes the new map. George’s task is to see that the place-names on this map are…correct. (To YOLLAND) Just a few words – they’d like to hear from you. (To class) Don’t you want to hear George, too?
Maire: Has he anything to say?
Yolland: (To MAIRE) Sorry – sorry?
Owen: She says she is dying to hear from you.
Yolland: (To MAIRE) Very kind of you – thank you…(To class) I can only say that I feel – I feel very foolish to – to – to be working here and not to speak your language. But I intend to rectify that – with Roland’s help – indeed I do.
Owen: He wants me to teach him Irish!
Hugh: You are doubly welcome, sir.
Yolland: I think your countryside is – is – is – is very beautiful. I’ve fallen in love with it already. I hope we’re not too – too crude an intrusion on your lives. And I know that I’m going to be happy, very happy, here.

Manus: You weren’t saying what Lancey was saying.
Owen: ‘Uncertainty in meaning is incipient poetry’ – who said that?
Manus: There was nothing uncertain about what Lancey said: it’s a bloody military operation, Owen! And what’s Yolland’s function? What’s ‘incorrect’ about the place-names we have here?

Owen: Where there’s ambiguity, they’ll be Anglicised.",,,,,Explore how Friel presents Owen in this extract from Translations.,,"[""Form and structure: the extract occurs at the end of Act 1 just after the arrival of the English soldiers. The motives for Owen/Rowland’s mis-translation of Lancey, and where his loyalties lie, are not yet clear. The strikingly different English voices of Lancey and Yolland evident here – the abrupt, authoritarian and condescending assertions of Lancey versus the hesitant diffidence of Yolland, both contrasting with the straightforwardness of Owen’s voice, temporarily ameliorating the threat from Lancey. The concluding confrontation between the brothers Owen and Manus, with Manus’ suggestion that Owen has previously shown the capacity for duplicity or manipulation, ‘It’s the same Owen’, foreshadows the destructive internecine conflicts of Act 3."", ""Dramatic techniques: the inability of the two English characters to understand any of the languages spoken other than English (Irish and Latin) stands representative of their, and their country’s, levels of ignorance of the culture and education of the Baile Beag residents. Yolland’s respect and diffidence seems initially attractive, yet it his naivety and idealisation of Gaelic culture that is the catalyst for the tragic events that occur, ‘I hope we’re not too – too crude an intrusion on your lives’. Manus, hitherto seen as passive and powerless in the face of Hugh’s braggadocio, presented at the end of the scene as being more perceptive and a stronger defender of his community than previously suspected. Owen’s role as peacemaker, ironic given his position as Lancey’s agent. Owen’s assertion that Owen/Roland is ‘only a name’ is tragically challenged as the play progresses."", ""Discourse: Conversation analysis e.g. Owen’s key role in ameliorating the threat implicit in Lancey’s statement evident in the statement/translation adjacency pairs; his subordinate role relative to Lancey inverted by his power of being the insider and polyglot. Lancey’s is the language of bureaucratic certitude while Owen’s hedges and softens. Yolland’s desire to interact hopelessly naive in light of Lancey’s statement of intent: hesitation, repetition and self-effacement from this reluctant colonialist, ‘sorry-sorry’, ‘I feel very foolish’. Cross cultural misunderstanding and mis-truth gives way to a shared understanding, albeit one characterised by conflict, between Owen/Manus via a shared language at the end of the scene."", ""Lexis: the language of technological and colonial power and control ‘…triangulation…executed to a scale of six inches to the English mile’ from Lancey stripped out in Owen’s translation, ‘a new map’. Hugh’s language of the genial host ‘…friendship’ hospitality’ and every assistance…’ concealing for the moment his real feelings under the guise of not understanding English. Informal, colloquial, mildly taboo language of Owen/Manus ‘bloody ramrod’, ‘bloody military operation’, ‘you bastards’, suggesting intimacy and real emotions."", ""Grammar and morphology: Complex declaratives from Lancey denoting his surety and obliviousness to the sensitivities of his audience. Interrogatives from Manus later as he seeks to interrogate Manus."", ""Figurative language and rhetorical features: strong contrasts in register between Lancey, Yolland, Hugh and Owen. Owen’s ‘real’ voice emerges in duologue with Manus – a symmetry in language choices between the brothers hints perhaps at shared values."", ""Context (AO3): the impact of the English intrusion into the seemingly timeless culture of Baile Beag dramatised here, yet it is the English desire to sentimentalise Ireland rather than the colonial intent to map the territory that is catalyst for the destruction of the community. The play is non-didactic in this regard, Maire’s desire to learn English is for her as legitimate a response ‘to mud cabins and a diet of potatoes’ as Hugh’s defence of the Irish language. The end of Act 1 here with the meeting of Maire and Yolland and their misplaced motives in commencing a relationship ultimately fractures the tense co-existence of England and Ireland and creates the context for tragedy.""]",,,,32,,,

Loves the lasses. One May morning, he says, ‘I’m off for a walk.’ Now, his wife, who knows his ways of old, tracks the old goat’s scent up the road, round the corner, straight up to the door of her own sweet sister. She crepples inside, up the stairs, into the boudoir, to find sister bent double on a big brass bed, with Hector up the back, in the cheap seats, whooping it up with all his lusty puff. The wife pulls a pistol, draws a bead and shoots the wayward lad slap-bang in the love bells. The bullet passes clean through his scrotum, bounces off the bedpost, zings out the window, down the high street to the crossroads, where it hits the number 87 tram to Andover. The bullet passes through two inches of rusty metal, clean through an elderly lady’s packed lunch and lodges in my sweet mother’s sixteen-year-old womb. Eight months, three weeks, six days later. Out pops him. Smiling. With a bullet clenched between his teeth.
Ginger: First of all. Babies don’t have teeth.
Johnny: All Byron boys are born with teeth. Thirty-two chompers. And hair on them’s chest. No wailing or weeping. Talkin’, straight off. This one – me – he sits up, wipes the dew from his eyes and calls, ‘Mother, what is this dark place?’ And she replied, ‘’Tis England, my boy. England.’ And with that, I jumps off the bed, and out the door, and off I marched in my little black cloak.
Ginger: Where did that come from?
Johnny: What?
Ginger: The cloak. Where did the cloak come from?
Johnny: All Byron boys come with their own cloaks. My brother Cyril’s was red. Frank’s was green. I’m born in black. With black eyes. You watch a black-cloaked Byron boy like a hawk, and tend him like a wound. You bind him, you swaddle him tight. And when they searched me –
Ginger: Wait. Stop. They searched you.
Johnny: Of course.
Ginger: Why did they search you?
Johnny: Always search a Byron boy at birth. You never know what he’s got on him. A Byron boy comes with three things. A cloak and a dagger, and his own teeth. He comes fully equipped. He doesn’t need nothing. And when he dies, he lies in the ground like a lump of granite. He don’t rot. There’s Byron boys buried all over this land, lying in the ground as fresh as the day they was planted. In them’s cloaks. With the teeth sharp. Fingernails sharp. And the two black eyes, staring out, sharp as spears. You get close and stare into those black eyes, watch out. Written there is old words that will shake you. Shake you down.
Ginger: Let’s get back to the bullet. Let’s go back to the bit where you were born on the tip of a speeding bullet.
Johnny: You don’t believe me.
He takes a bullet from his pocket. Tosses it to GINGER.
Ginger: Could be any old bullet.
He tosses it back.
Johnny: Any old bullet, eh? (He puts it between his teeth. Smiles.) So there you have it. I am the only man in history to be conceived in separate postal zones. Born one day early and I’ve been a day ahead of all you beggars ever since. (He smiles.)

All year the flax-dam festered in the heart
Of the townland; green and heavy-headed
Flax had rotted there, weighted down by huge sods.
Daily it sweltered in the punishing sun.
Bubbles gargled delicately, bluebottles
Wove a strong gauze of sound around the smell.
There were dragonflies, spotted butterflies,
But best of all was the warm thick slobber
Of frogspawn that grew like clotted water
In the shade of the banks. Here, every spring
I would fill jampotfuls of the jellied
Specks to range on window-sills at home,
On shelves at school, and wait and watch until
The fattening dots burst into nimble Swimming tadpoles. Miss Walls would tell us how
The daddy frog was called a bullfrog
And how he croaked and how the mammy frog
Laid hundreds of little eggs and this was
Frogspawn. You could tell the weather by frogs too
For they were yellow in the sun and brown
In rain.

Then one hot day when fields were rank
With cowdung in the grass the angry frogs
Invaded the flax-dam; I ducked through hedges
To a coarse croaking that I had not heard
Before. The air was thick with a bass chorus.
Right down the dam gross-bellied frogs were cocked
On sods; their loose necks pulsed like sails. Some hopped:
The slap and plop were obscene threats. Some sat
Poised like mud grenades, their blunt heads farting.
I sickened, turned, and ran. The great slime kings
Were gathered there for vengeance and I knew
That if I dipped my hand the spawn would clutch it.",,,,,Explore how Heaney presents childhood memories and discoveries in ‘Death of a Naturalist’.,,"[""Voice and Tone: 1st person narration of childhood memory from adult perspective.

Breakfast over, islanded by noise,
she watches the machines go fast and slow.
She stands among them as they shake the house.
They move. Their destination is specific.
She has nowhere definite to go:
she might be a pedestrian in traffic.

White surfaces retract. White
sideboards light the white of walls.
Cups wink white in their saucers.
The light of day bleaches as it falls
on cups and sideboards. She could use
the room to tap with if she lost her sight.

Machines jigsaw everything she knows.
And she is everywhere among their furor:
the tropic of the dryer tumbling clothes.
The round lunar window of the washer.
The kettle in the toaster is a kingfisher
swooping for trout above the river’s mirror.

The wash done, the kettle boiled, the sheets
spun and clean, the dryer stops dead.
The silence is a death. It starts to bury
the room in white spaces. She turns to spread
a cloth on the board and irons sheets
in a room white and quiet as a mortuary.",,,,,Explore how Boland presents ideas and attitudes towards the rituals of household work in ‘Woman in Kitchen’.,,"[""Voice: 3rd person narrative in the continuous present tense, suggesting detachment and emphasising the indifference of the appliances and the speaker’s limited, disenfranchised role."", ""Form: 4 stanzas of six lines of 8-12 syllables.

where I say goodbye to south-east London for the next 3 years
a gaggle of us still damp spilling in from the night before
early flock for a Sunday six or seven a.m. sleepless
drowning in light and all this quiet after all that sweat
and darkness all that flighty noise

this is the year one of the guys says music is the one thing
that won’t ever let him down that music is his religion

the year we’re stopped and searched because we
fit the description the year jungle music passes
out of fashion stripped down

to naked beat and bass and we club together to dance
alone in the dark let the music play us meat and bone

let music fill the empty spaces rhythm in wads and scads
scattershot crashing wall to wall to be baptised
by filtered drums pressed snares and swollen b-lines

be baptised by city songs urban hymns seamless
sound a brimming sea of sound poured out

from towering speaker stacks this is the year we stand
close enough to feel the music rise its wing-beats
on our faces drawing salt from our skin released

then morning small fries and a strawberry milkshake
counting coins for the cab back sitting around a table

slouching in moulded seats drowning in silence
light-headed leavened waiting
for the right moment to move

awake for too long ears
still ringing drum-drunk

eyes still adjusting to the light
a weight coming down",,,,,Explore how Sam-La Rose presents ideas and feelings about the experience and impact of music.,,"[""Voice: 1st person fragmented narrative, continuous present tense."", ""Form: 12 stanzas of 2 or 3 lines, one extended, fragmented sentence.

Jack: (in a clear, cold voice) Miss Cardew is the granddaughter of the late Mr Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.
Lady Bracknell: That sounds not unsatisfactory. Three addresses always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen. But what proof have I of their authenticity?
Jack: I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period. They are open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.
Lady Bracknell: (grimly) I have known strange errors in that publication.
Jack: Miss Cardew’s family solicitors are Messrs Markby, Markby, and Markby.
Lady Bracknell: Markby, Markby, and Markby? A firm of the very highest position in their profession. Indeed I am told that one of the Mr Markbys is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties. So far I am satisfied.
Jack: (very irritably) How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell! I have also in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of Miss Cardew’s birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration, vaccination, confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the English variety.
Lady Bracknell: Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young girl. I am not myself in favour of premature experiences. (Rises, looks at her watch) Gwendolen! the time approaches for our departure. We have not a moment to lose. As a matter of form, Mr Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little fortune?
Jack: Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds. That is all. Good-bye, Lady Bracknell. So pleased to have seen you.
Lady Bracknell: (sitting down again) A moment, Mr Worthing. A hundred and thirty thousand pounds! And in the Funds! Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her. Few girls of the present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last, and improve with time. We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces. (To Cecily) Come over here, dear. (Cecily goes across) Pretty child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it. But we can soon alter all that.
