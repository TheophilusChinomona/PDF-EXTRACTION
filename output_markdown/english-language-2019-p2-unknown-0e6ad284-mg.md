## SECTION B

### Question 1 [20 marks] (Application Question)

**Topic:** Child Language Acquisition

**Child Language Development - Beth (3;5) and Tom (4;2)**

> **Marker instruction:** Decide on a mark for AO1 out of 10, and then a separate mark for AO2 out of 10. Add the two marks together to reach a total out of 20 marks.

**Introduction:**
- Examine the language development stage of the child-participants as evidenced in the transcript.
- Identify and analyse the phonology, grammar and meaning of their utterances.
- Use knowledge of theories and concepts of child language acquisition to support the answer.

**Body:**

*Meaning*
  - Beth uses labelling correctly ‘cars’ and also the more abstract concept ‘direction’ – this may be seen as advanced for her chronological age.
  - Beth initiates and directs the play throughout.
  - Beth shifts the terms of the play so that the play suddenly takes place in imaginary water and then the car turns into an imaginary hamburger.

*Phonology*
  - Gliding/substitution ‘/t/w/actor/’.
  - Repetition of ‘bang’, twice with added emphasis; this word is also onomatopoeic.
  - Rhyming of ‘bash splash’ suggests playful experimentation with sound.
  - Beth tries to mimic the sound of a car.
  - Beth’s pronunciation of ‘bath’ as b/æ/th may suggest Northern accent.
  - Both children use largely standard pronunciation.
  - One of Tom’s two verbal utterances is indistinct.

*Grammar*
  - Beth uses interrogatives (‘which way’) and declaratives (‘it’s landed under your leg’).
  - Stressed word ‘bang’ suggests an exclamatory function.
  - Correct range of pronouns and possessive determiners: ‘whatever I like’, ‘it banged off my leg onto you’.
  - Range of dynamic verbs: ‘driving’, ‘landed’, ‘splash’.
  - Past tense used accurately but over-generalised in future construction: ‘shall we banged another one’.
  - Concrete nouns reflecting topic: ‘car’, ‘leg’, ‘water’.
  - Present progressive ‘my car’s driving down the road’ (link to Brown/acquisition of -ing).
  - Present simple ‘it’s not water’ and past simple ‘it banged’.
  - Modal verbs: ‘I can do’, ‘shall we banged’.
  - Standard syntax (subject-verb-adverbial) used appropriately.

*Mother's Interventions (Scaffolding)*
  - Mix of interrogative and declarative functions to provide scaffolding.
  - Supports Beth’s imaginative leap (‘oh no I’m all wet’).
  - Recasts Beth’s non-standard pronunciation of ‘tractor’.
  - Responds to Tom’s non-verbal utterance ‘[yawns]’.

*Concepts and Theories*
  - Halliday: Tom’s directive ‘drive it out’ serves a regulatory function.
  - Chomsky: Beth’s non-standard ‘shall we banged’ supports the theory that language is not just copied.
  - Bruner: Mother’s interaction provides scaffolding.
  - Skinner: Mother’s modelling of standard pronunciation of ‘tractor’.
  - Nelson: Utterances revolving around objects support findings that naming words represent 60% of early production.
  - Goodwin: Tom’s imperatives linked to research on male assertions of power.
  - Piaget: Capacity for imaginative play suggests cognitive development.

*Note: Text A is a transcript from a private data source. Beth and Tom are playing in a car.*

### Question 2 [24 marks] (Application Question)

**Topic:** Gender, Representation, and Power

**Language Features and Contextual Factors - MasterChef Online Article**

> **Marker instruction:** Decide on a mark for AO2 out of 12, and then a separate mark for AO3 out of 12. Add the two marks together to reach a total out of 24 marks.

**Introduction:**
- Extract from an online article on The Independent website (lifestyle section).
- Topic: ‘MasterChef’, gender, representation, and hierarchy in professional kitchens.

**Body:**

*Text Features (Lexis, Graphology, Grammar)*
  - Accompanying image of three male chefs reflects topic; body language and superlative ‘best’ suggest positive responses to gendered presuppositions.
  - Connective ‘So why can’t...’ creates conversational tone (Goodman - informalisation).
  - Paragraph of interrogatives creates exploration; representation of male judges as intimidating conforms to gender stereotypes (Pilkington).
  - Workplace assumptions (Cameron/Law): females seen as nurturing, males for logic-based high-pressure roles.
  - Graphological features typical of genre (social media links).
  - Lexical fields of cookery and critiquing: ‘poached’, ‘ingredient’, ‘food writer’.
  - Proper nouns establish credibility/influential power (Fairclough).
  - Intensifiers/empty adjectives in female winner's quote (‘particularly… very…brilliant’) support Lakoff.
  - Military metaphor: ‘finalists battled it out’.

*Pragmatics*
  - Intensifier adverb ‘really’ in title explores reader assumptions.
  - Representing women as emotionally fragile (‘ladies stand the heat’); use of ‘ladies’ may be ironic or patronising.
  - Challenging stereotypes: male judge (John Torode) reduced to tears.
  - Prejudice that men make better chefs supported by anecdote (female contestant's dish causing retching).
  - Assumptions about shared cultural references (Aeschylus, Cervantes, The Female Eunuch) linked to Fairclough’s members’ resources.
  - Idiomatic reference ‘the fairer sex’ may link to semantic derogation.
  - Humour/gender-based metaphor: ‘crucial ingredient: a generous dollop of Y chromosome’.

### Question 3 [36 marks] (Comparative Essay)

**Topic:** Language Variation Over Time

**Diachronic Variation - Beekeeping Texts (1770 vs 1946)**

> **Marker instruction:** Decide on a mark for AO1 out of 12, AO3 out of 12, and AO4 out of 12. Add marks together for total out of 36.

**Introduction:**
- Text C: 'A Treatise on the Management of Bees' by Thomas Wildman (1770).
- Text D: 'Honey Farming' by R.O.B. Manley (1946).
- Discuss and illustrate variations in language between the 18th and 20th centuries.

**Body:**

*Lexis and Semantics*
  - Text C: Concrete nouns for physical attacks ('slugs', 'snails'); Latinate language ('proprietor', 'endeavour'); Abstract nouns for impact ('havock', 'disturbance'); Hyperbole for predators ('evil').
  - Text D: Concrete nouns for environment ('combs', 'wax'); Lexical field of conflict ('battle', 'manoeuvres'); Specialist jargon ('queen-right colonies'); Use of dates and numbers for specificity.

*Grammar and Morphology*
  - Text C: Archaic orthography ('havock', long s); Clause-laden sentences but with many simple sentences for the mode; Active sentences foregrounding damage; Archaic intensifiers ('great plenty').
  - Text D: Primary auxiliary/copular verbs for factual info; Complex sentences with conditional subordinates; Dynamic verbs ('destroy', 'wiped out'); Comparative adjectives ('far stronger').

*Discourse and Pragmatics*
  - Text C: Structured by listing categories of enemies; Frames attacks as against property ('treasure'); High moral tone; Readers represented as guardians of vulnerable bees.
  - Text D: Anecdotal and discursive style; Emphasis on shared interest ('our colonies'); Personification of wasps ('intelligent'); Personal experience and camaraderie with other beekeepers.

**Conclusion:**
- Text C is slightly more moralistic and hyperbolic in its representation of enemies.
- Text D is more individual and discursive, drawing on personal experience and contemporary historical context (war metaphors).
