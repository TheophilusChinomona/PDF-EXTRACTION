Here, every spring\nI would fill jampotfuls of the jellied\nSpecks to range on window-sills at home,\nOn shelves at school, and wait and watch until\nThe fattening dots burst into nimble Swimming tadpoles. Miss Walls would tell us how\nThe daddy frog was called a bullfrog\nAnd how he croaked and how the mammy frog\nLaid hundreds of little eggs and this was\nFrogspawn. You could tell the weather by frogs too\nFor they were yellow in the sun and brown\nIn rain.\n\nThen one hot day when fields were rank\nWith cowdung in the grass the angry frogs\nInvaded the flax-dam; I ducked through hedges\nTo a coarse croaking that I had not heard\nBefore. The air was thick with a bass chorus.\nRight down the dam gross-bellied frogs were cocked\nOn sods; their loose necks pulsed like sails. Some hopped:\nThe slap and plop were obscene threats. Some sat\nPoised like mud grenades, their blunt heads farting.\nI sickened, turned, and ran. The great slime kings\nWere gathered there for vengeance and I knew\nThat if I dipped my hand the spawn would clutch it.",

I think some preliminary enquiry on my part would not be out of place. Mr Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all connected with any of the larger railway stations in London? I merely desire information. Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any families or persons whose origin was a Terminus. (Jack looks perfectly furious, but restrains himself)\nJack: (in a clear, cold voice) Miss Cardew is the granddaughter of the late Mr Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.\nLady Bracknell: That sounds not unsatisfactory. Three addresses always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen. But what proof have I of their authenticity?\nJack: I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period. They are open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.\nLady Bracknell: (grimly) I have known strange errors in that publication.\nJack: Miss Cardew’s family solicitors are Messrs Markby, Markby, and Markby.\nLady Bracknell: Markby, Markby, and Markby? A firm of the very highest position in their profession. Indeed I am told that one of the Mr Markbys is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties. So far I am satisfied.\nJack: (very irritably) How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell! I have also in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of Miss Cardew’s birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration, vaccination, confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the English variety.\nLady Bracknell: Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young girl. I am not myself in favour of premature experiences. (Rises, looks at her watch) Gwendolen! the time approaches for our departure. We have not a moment to lose. As a matter of form, Mr Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little fortune?\nJack: Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds. That is all. Good-bye, Lady Bracknell. So pleased to have seen you.\nLady Bracknell: (sitting down again) A moment, Mr Worthing. A hundred and thirty thousand pounds! And in the Funds! Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her. Few girls of the present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last, and improve with time. We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces. (To Cecily) Come over here, dear. (Cecily goes across) Pretty child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it. But we can soon alter all that. A thoroughly experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space of time. I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after three months her own husband did not know her.",

And what’s Yolland’s function? What’s ‘incorrect’ about the place-names we have here?\nOwen: Nothing at all. They’re just going to be standardised.\nManus: You mean changed into English?\nOwen: Where there’s ambiguity, they’ll be Anglicised.",

          "scenario": "Johnny: See, my father, Hector Byron, was a philanderer. Loves the lasses. One May morning, he says, ‘I’m off for a walk.’ Now, his wife, who knows his ways of old, tracks the old goat’s scent up the road, round the corner, straight up to the door of her own sweet sister. She crepples inside, up the stairs, into the boudoir, to find sister bent double on a big brass bed, with Hector up the back, in the cheap seats, whooping it up with all his lusty puff. The wife pulls a pistol, draws a bead and shoots the wayward lad slap-bang in the love bells. The bullet passes clean through his scrotum, bounces off the bedpost, zings out the window, down the high street to the crossroads, where it hits the number 87 tram to Andover. The bullet passes through two inches of rusty metal, clean through an elderly lady’s packed lunch and lodges in my sweet mother’s sixteen-year-old womb. Eight months, three weeks, six days later. Out pops him. Smiling. With a bullet clenched between his teeth.\nGinger: First of all. Babies don’t have teeth.\nJohnny: All Byron boys are born with teeth. Thirty-two chompers. And hair on them’s chest. No wailing or weeping. Talkin’, straight off. This one – me – he sits up, wipes the dew from his eyes and calls, ‘Mother, what is this dark place?’ And she replied, ‘’Tis England, my boy. England.’ And with that, I jumps off the bed, and out the door, and off I marched in my little black cloak.\nGinger: Where did that come from?\nJohnny: What?\nGinger: The cloak. Where did the cloak come from?\nJohnny: All Byron boys come with their own cloaks. My brother Cyril’s was red. Frank’s was green. I’m born in black. With black eyes. You watch a black-cloaked Byron boy like a hawk, and tend him like a wound. You bind him, you swaddle him tight. And when they searched me –\nGinger: Wait. Stop. They searched you.\nJohnny: Of course.\nGinger: Why did they search you?\nJohnny: Always search a Byron boy at birth. You never know what he’s got on him. A Byron boy comes with three things. A cloak and a dagger, and his own teeth. He comes fully equipped. He doesn’t need nothing. And when he dies, he lies in the ground like a lump of granite. He don’t rot. There’s Byron boys buried all over this land, lying in the ground as fresh as the day they was planted. In them’s cloaks. With the teeth sharp. Fingernails sharp. And the two black eyes, staring out, sharp as spears. You get close and stare into those black eyes, watch out. Written there is old words that will shake you. Shake you down.\nGinger: Let’s get back to the bullet. Let’s go back to the bit where you were born on the tip of a speeding bullet.\nJohnny: You don’t believe me.\nHe takes a bullet from his pocket. Tosses it to GINGER.\nGinger: Could be any old bullet.\nHe tosses it back.\nJohnny: Any old bullet, eh? (He puts it between his teeth. Smiles.) So there you have it. I am the only man in history to be conceived in separate postal zones. Born one day early and I’ve been a day ahead of all you beggars ever since. (He smiles.)\nAll: Bollocks! Bullshit!",
