So is the competition just too hot for women? Tom Peck and Sunjay Kakar find out\nWednesday 7 April 2010 23:00 BST\n\n© Press Association, www.paimages.co.uk.

Last night 34-year-old sales director Dhruv Baker became the fifth male in a row to be named champion of MasterChef. Since the BBC show’s re-launch in 2005, sans Loyd Grossman, only one woman, Thomasina Miers, has lifted the trophy. And as last night’s finalists battled it out over saffron and ginger poached lobster tail and blue cheese ice-cream, all three competitors, as last year, shared one seemingly crucial ingredient: a generous dollop of Y chromosome.\n\nSo why can’t the ladies stand the heat? Is it the sharp forks and spiky tongues of judges Greg Wallace and John Torode? The pressure of the clock? The relentless soundtrack of high-energy breaks and beats that have come to characterise the series?\n\nFor Miers, now a successful food writer and restaurateur, it is a mystery. “John and Greg particularly made me feel that I was strong enough in the kitchen to work as a professional chef, which wasn’t something I had ever dreamed about before MasterChef,” she said. “I don’t think being male or female has anything to do with whether you are a brilliant chef. Both men and women are very strong in the arts and it is surely down to the individual whether they are talented in the kitchen.”\n\nAccording to a spokesman for the series: “We do not offer places on the competition based on gender and the judges base their selection on the plate of food in front of them, not the sex of the person who cooks it.”\n\nCertainly anyone who saw the semi-final would be hard pressed not to agree. Food critic Kate Spicer physically retched on tasting the gin and tonic jelly with white chocolate mousse offered by the last lady to be eliminated, 2010 semi-finalist Stacie Stewart – and that would have proved the final lump in the custard for any competitor, male or female.\n\nBut elsewhere, it seems a woman’s place is not in the kitchen. The 2010 Michelin Guide gave its coveted stars to 140 restaurants in the UK. Only 11 have a female name above the door.\n\nMasterChef in numbers\n1 woman has won MasterChef since it was relaunched in 2005. Thomasina Miers has since opened two branches of her Mexican street food restaurant Wahaca in London.\n11 restaurants in the UK with Michelin stars have female head chefs; that’s out of a total of 140 restaurants.\n19 years was the age of the 2008 MasterChef finalist Emily Ludolf. Her bacon, scallop, beetroot and chervil concoction reduced judge John Torode to tears.\n\nMore about: Chefs, Cookery, Fine Dining, Restaurants",

VIII.\nOf Enemies to bees.\n\nTHE proprietor having provided for his bees as great plenty of paʃture as he poʃʃibly can, ʃhould next be as careful to guard them from the many enemies which either annoy or ʃeek to prey upon them. Theʃe are of three ʃorts. The firʃt are weak harmleʃs inʃects, which creep into a hive, without well knowing whither they are going, and only raiʃe diʃturbances and confuʃion in it: the ʃecond endeavour to deʃtroy the bees, and eat up their honey; and the miʃchief of the laʃt is levelled only at their wax.\n\nIn the firʃt claʃs, we may reckon ʃlugs and ʃnails. Spiders ʃeem hardly to deʃerve being ranked among the enemies to bees, becauʃe their webs are too weak to entangle a bee. Ants ʃometimes make their neʃts in the coverings of hives, without molesting or being moleʃted.\n\nSeveral birds are numbered in the ʃecond claʃs. Sparrows make great havock amongʃt bees, eʃpecially in the ʃpring, in order to feed their young. Swallows are alʃo mentioned in this light. The houʃe-lark, a little dun bird with a black bill, is a great deʃtroyer of bees. The only remedy here is, to deʃtroy the birds, and hire boys to rob their neʃts. Traps to catch birds, being baited with dead bees, may be placed near the hives.\n\nThe field-mouʃe is an enemy to be carefully guarded againʃt as ʃoon as the cold begins to approach: for if it enters at that ʃeaʃon it makes dreadful havock. At firʃt it deʃtroys the loweʃt parts of the combs; but as the weather grows colder, and the bees more torpid, it aʃcends up the hive, and ʃeizes on the richeʃt treaʃure: nor does the evil end here: for other bees, ʃmelling the honey ʃpilt by the mouʃe, fall upon the hive, and rob it of what remained; or as ʃoon as the warm weather returns, and the bees ʃtir about, they are ʃometimes ʃo diʃguʃted at the havock made by the mouʃe, that they deʃert the hive. The only way to guard againʃt this, is to prevent its entering into a hive.",

It was published in 1946 and this extract was taken from the chapter on Pests and Diseases.\n\nEnemies of Hive-bees\n\nIt is usual to add a few notes about the larger creatures that are, or are supposed to be, injurious to bees. There are two species of moth whose larvae live upon the combs of bees, devouring the wax of which they are made. These are a great nuisance to stored combs, and to weak colonies. The large moth’s caterpillars will very quickly destroy combs stored away if once introduced to them. The moths may be found by hundreds, sometimes, in neglected hives of combs, and in such cases the whole will be a mass of webbing and excreta, with cocoons and larva. Fire is the best remedy when this is the case. It is hard on the caterpillars and moths but one can’t be sentimental at such times.\n\nThe lesser wax moth is also a nuisance in stored combs, but it gets into sections of comb honey too, where it does a good deal of mischief at times. Neither of these insects is a really serious menace in the British Isles if the beekeeper knows his job and stores his combs away suitably. Both dislike cold weather and do no damage in winter unless in warm storerooms or in a house; but if the moth has laid eggs these ought to be treated in some way to kill the resulting grubs and moths. I have never had occasion to do this, but Mr. Wedmore gives several methods of fumigating combs in storage. Personally, I should try a sulphur candle if I had to use anything.\n\nWasps are in some seasons very serious enemies of our bees. I have only suffered considerable loss from these creatures on two or three occasions. Usually very little trouble is required to counteract them, but in 1942 and 1944, for the first time in my experience, wasps completely wiped out a number of queen-right colonies. All of those destroyed were summer nuclei just becoming strong, and with a queen of the current year. I suppose that there were not enough old fighting bees in them to enable them to keep out the wasps. Wasps, therefore, do sometimes rob our colonies of bees, especially if the entrances to the hives are large. On these occasions, on opening the robbed hive after the battle, it will be found crowded with thousands of bloated wasps, which might well be mistaken for queens at a first glance. Wasps, however, are in most years no more than a very minor nuisance, and about all one can do is to contract all entrances to keep them out. Wasps, however, are far stronger and more determined than bees; they are, apparently, more intelligent, and almost seem to employ reason in their manoeuvres. This comes from their being less specialized than bees, I suppose. You can destroy their nests, no doubt---if you can find them; but I have destroyed a great many in some seasons without producing the smallest noticeable reduction in the number of wasps seen about the hives.",
