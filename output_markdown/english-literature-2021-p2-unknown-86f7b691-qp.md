<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

When [the girl] broke into the swift rattling measures of a chorus some half-tipsy men near the stage joined in the rollicking refrain and glasses were pounded rhythmically upon the tables... As a final effort, the singer rendered some verses which described a vision of Britain being annihilated by America, and Ireland bursting her bonds. A carefully prepared crisis was reached in the last line of the last verse, where the singer threw out her arms and cried, ‘The star-spangled banner.’ Instantly a great cheer swelled from the throats of the assemblage of the masses, most of them of foreign birth. Stephen Crane, Maggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893). Footnote 1: imitation of a plantation darky: this act, imitating an African American slave, would now be considered offensive.
