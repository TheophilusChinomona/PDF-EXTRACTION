## CLOSE READING (UNSEEN)

### Question 1 [30 marks] (Close reading)

**Critical appreciation of the passage relating to American Literature 1880–1940**

> **Marker instruction:** The dominant assessment objective is AO2 (Analyse ways in which meanings are shaped in literary texts). AO1 and AO3 are also assessed. Use the Level Descriptors for Critical appreciation of an unseen passage.

- Passage is written in the first person; narrator is one of the assembled men.
- Osgood’s characterisation: pale, balding man who seems out of place in the Wild West.

- Speech styles: Osgood’s ‘orating’ vs. the men’s simpler, direct address (‘To hell with that.’).
- Context: Wild West in the 1880s; 1940 date of composition provides distance/perspective.
- Social issues: Osgood’s denigration of ‘Indians’ as ‘savages’ is racist.
- Tone: Anger and desire for action are in the ascendancy; trouble is likely to ensue.
- Links: The Grapes of Wrath, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (lawlessness and challenge to authority).

*Note: This indicative content is not prescriptive nor exclusive; reward original but well-focused answers.*
