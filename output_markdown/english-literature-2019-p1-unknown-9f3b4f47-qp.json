What wouldst thou? Thy name?\nWhy speak’st not? Speak, man. What’s thy name?\nCORIOLANUS [Unmuffling] If, Tullus,\nNot yet thou know’st me, and, seeing me, dost not\nThink me for the man I am, necessity\nCommands me name myself.\nAUFIDIUS What is thy name?\nCORIOLANUS A name unmusical to the Volscians’ ears,\nAnd harsh in sound to thine.\nAUFIDIUS Say, what’s thy name?\nThou hast a grim appearance, and thy face\nBears a command in’t; though thy tackle’s torn,\nThou show’st a noble vessel. What’s thy name?\nCORIOLANUS Prepare thy brow to frown – know’st thou me yet?\nAUFIDIUS I know thee not. Thy name?\nCORIOLANUS My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done\nTo thee particularly, and to all the Volsces,\nGreat hurt and mischief; thereto witness may\nMy surname, Coriolanus. The painful service,\nThe extreme dangers, and the drops of blood\nShed for my thankless country, are requited\nBut with that surname – a good memory\nAnd witness of the malice and displeasure\nWhich thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains;\nThe cruelty and envy of the people,\nPermitted by our dastard nobles, who\nHave all forsook me, hath devour’d the rest,\nAnd suffer’d me by th’ voice of slaves to be\nWhoop’d out of Rome. Now this extremity\nHath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope,\nMistake me not, to save my life; for if\nI had fear’d death, of all the men i’ th’ world\nI would have ’voided thee; but in mere spite,\nTo be full quit of those my banishers,\nStand I before thee here. Then if thou hast\nA heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge\nThine own particular wrongs and stop those maims\nOf shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight\nAnd make my misery serve thy turn. So use it\nThat my revengeful services may prove\nAs benefits to thee; for I will fight\nAgainst my cank’red country with the spleen\nOf all the under fiends. But if so be\nThou dar’st not this, and that to prove more fortunes\nTh’art tir’d, then, in a word, I also am\nLonger to live most weary, and present\nMy throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;\nWhich not to cut would show thee but a fool,\nSince I have ever followed thee with hate,\nDrawn tuns of blood out of thy country’s breast,\nAnd cannot live but to thy shame, unless\nIt be to do thee service.\nAUFIDIUS O Marcius, Marcius!\nEach word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart\nA root of ancient envy.",
