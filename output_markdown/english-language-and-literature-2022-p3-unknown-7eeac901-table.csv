Storyline 1
• The dinghy beached at low-tide.
• English summer days are long, so we knew we had plenty of time to get ashore, including all the children.
• Fifteen of us got out, splashing on the shingle.
• As I had suspected, the Coastguard were waiting: three burly figures in high-viz jackets.
• I had come a long way, parted with a lot of money, and spoke very good English.
• I was ready with my answer when one of them asked me, ‘What are you doing in England?’

Storyline 2
• All day long the old woman struggles with her house and the objects in it.
• The doors will not shut.
• The plaster walls dampen with rain.
• She finds dead insects everywhere.
• In desperation she exhausts herself sweeping, dusting, mending.
• At night she sinks into bed. The house has a life of its own.
