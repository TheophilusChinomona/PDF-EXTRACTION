## SECTION 1

### Question 1(a) [15 marks] (Shakespeare Passage Analysis)

**Coriolanus - Act 4 Scene 5**

> **Marker instruction:** In Section 1, part (a), the dominant assessment objective is: AO2. Analyse ways in which meanings are shaped in literary texts. Use level descriptor tables for part a) and add to part b) for total out of 30.

- Candidates may choose to comment on the fact that this is an extract ‘of two halves’ – firstly presenting the unmasking of Coriolanus following his humiliating treatment at the hands of servants after his arrival at ‘a hall in Aufidius’s house’
- expressing emotions only partly under control in well-constructed rhetoric
- The subtle inter-relationship between Coriolanus and Aufidius demonstrated in both parts of the passage is characteristic of their complex synergy throughout the play
- Dramatic intensity in the question-and-answer dialogue between ‘master’ and ‘guest’ at the opening of the passage (a reversal of roles)
- Catechistic tone and the mounting effect of the range of questions posed by both main characters
- Monosyllabic, brusque nature of Aufidius’s utterances (‘What is thy name?’)
- The coup de théâtre indicated by the brief direction ‘Unmuffling’
- Pace changes in the long unravelling of Coriolanus’s final speech
- Rhetorical devices: long, balanced sentences; the sequencing of thoughts; the pivot at ‘But’ (public speaking techniques)
- Frequent repetition of the first person ‘I’ and ‘My’ in the speech
- Ruminations about his own name remind the audience of Coriolanus’s obsession with himself

### Question 1(b) [15 marks] (Shakespeare Essay)

**Coriolanus - The conflicts presented in the play are rarely straightforward**

> **Marker instruction:** In Section 1, part (b), the equally weighted assessment objectives are AO1 and AO5. Use level descriptor tables for part b) and add to part a) for total out of 30.

- His involvement in the local wars of the period
- Patrician confrontations with the people’s tribunes and his obsessive entanglement with Aufidius
