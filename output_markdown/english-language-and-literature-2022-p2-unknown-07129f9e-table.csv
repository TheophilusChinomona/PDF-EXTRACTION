Hugh: James.

Bridget: Eamon Donal from Tor! Cripes!
Hugh: And after then caerimonia nominationis – Maire?
Maire: The ritual of naming.
Hugh: Indeed – we then had a few libations to mark the occasion. Altogether very pleasant. The derivation of the word ‘baptise’? – where are my Greek scholars? Doalty?
Doalty: Would it be – ah – ah –
Hugh: Too slow. James?
Jimmy: ‘Baptizein’ – to dip or immerse.
Hugh: Indeed – our friend Pliny Minor speaks of the ‘baptisterium’ – the cold bath.
Doalty: Master.
Hugh: Doalty?
Doalty: I suppose you could talk then about baptising a sheep at sheep-dipping, could you?
[Laughter. Comments.]
Hugh: Indeed – the precedent is there – the day you were appropriately named Doalty – seven nines?
Doalty: What’s that, Master?
Hugh: Seven times nine?
Doalty: Seven nines – seven nines – seven times nine – seven times nine are – Cripes, it’s on the tip of my tongue, Master – I knew it for sure this morning – funny that’s the only one that foxes me –
Bridget [prompt]: Sixty-three.
Doalty: What’s wrong with me: sure seven nines are fifty-three, Master.

Hugh: And Nora Dan?
Maire: She says she’s not coming back any more.

Mary: ‘Whilst there is life there is hope, Sir; perhaps my brother may recover.’
Ralph: That’s excellent, Brenham, very fluent. You could read a little louder. Now I’ll read.
 ‘We have but little reason to expect it. Poor Owen! But the decree is just; I was pleased with the death of my father, because he left me an estate, and now I’m punished with the loss of an heir to inherit mine.’
[Pause. He laughs a little.]
 This is comedy. They don’t really mean it. It’s to make people laugh. ‘The death of your brother makes you sole heiress to my estate, which you know is about twelve hundred pounds a year.’
Dabby: Twelve hundred pounds! It must be a comedy.
Mary: ‘My desire of being punctual in my obedience requires that you would be plain in your commands, Sir.’
Dabby: Well said, Mary, well said.
Ralph: I think that’s enough. You read very well, Brenham. Would you also be able to copy the play? We have only two copies.
Dabby: Course she will. Where do I come in, Lieutenant? The cousin.
Ralph: Can you read, Bryant?
Dabby: Not those marks in the books, Lieutenant, but I can read other things. I read dreams very well, Lieutenant. Very well.
Ralph: I don’t think you’re right for Melinda. I’m thinking of someone else. And if you can’t read …

Dabby: I grew up in Devon, Lieutenant. I’m perfect for Rose. What does she do?
Ralph: She – well, it’s complicated. She falls in love with Silvia.

In convoy, warbling along on powerful tyres,

Silos, chill gates, wet slates, the greens and reds
Of outhouse roofs. Whom should I run to tell

Dressed in the colours of a country day –
Grey-blue, blue-grey, the white of seagulls’ bodies –
Chardin’s peasant woman
Is to be found at all times in her short delay
Of dreams, her eyes mixed
Between love and market, empty flagons of wine
At her feet, bread under her arm. He has fixed
Her limbs in colour, and her heart in line.

In her right hand, the hindlegs of a hare
Peep from a cloth sack; through the door
Another woman moves
In painted daylight; nothing in this bare
Closet has been lost
Or changed. I think of what great art removes:
Hazard and death, the future and the past,
This woman’s secret history and her loves –

And even the dawn market, from whose bargaining
She has just come back, where men and women
Congregate and go
Among the produce, learning to live from morning
To next day, linked

I stumbled about, dazed, the music beating hysterically in my ears. 
It was dark.

RALPH ELLISON, 
The Invisible Man

There’s rider in a desert, seeking water.
He is his own horse, a saddle on his back.
There’s nothing but the walking, one step
after another towards a laughing horizon.

The sky wants him to fix a grin on his face.
Bare his white teeth. Why aren’t you smiling?
Why wear that dark face all day long? Take it off.
The sun, a spotlight. Under its attention, he glowers,

turns darker still. Becomes his own shadow.
Take it off. Step into the light.
He learns to sleep while walking. Dreams
of oceans, cool and black. Keeps on stepping.

The air rises in welts. He doesn’t know
what water looks like, but will when he sees it.
Step by barefoot step, the sand is white and burning.
The sun fingers his hair without asking,

the light, too much to bear. His throat is parched.
Cracked. And there’s no one here to talk to.
The sand gets everywhere. Between his toes.
Under his tongue. In his ears.",,,,,Explore how Jacob Sam La-Rose presents ideas and feelings about cultural identity in ‘Turning Darker Still’ and make connections with one or two other poems from your collection.,"AO1, AO2, AO3, AO4 assessed.

 With that which he hath drunk tonight already,
 He’ll be as full of quarrel and offence
 As my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,
 Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,
 To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
 Potations pottle-deep, and he’s to watch.
 Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
 That hold their honours in a wary distance,
 The very elements of this warlike isle,
 Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups;
 And they watch too. Now, ’mongst this flock of drunkards,
 Am I to put our Cassio in some action
 That may offend the isle. But here they come.

[Enter CASSIO, MONTANO and GENTLEMEN.]

 If consequence do but approve my dream,
 My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
Cassio: ’Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
Montano: Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a soldier.
Iago: Some wine, ho!

[Sings]

And let me the cannikin clink, clink,
And let me the cannikin clink;
A soldier’s a man,
O, man’s life’s but a span,
Why then, let a soldier drink.
 Some wine, boys!
Cassio: ’Fore God, an excellent song.
Iago: I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting. Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander – drink, ho! – are nothing to your English.
Cassio: Is your Englishman so exquisite in his drinking?
Iago: Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.
Cassio: To the health of our general!
Montano: I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you justice.
Iago: O sweet England!

[Sings]

King Stephen was and a worthy peer,
His breeches cost him but a crown;
He held them sixpence all too dear,
With that he called the tailor lown.

He was a wight of high renown,
And thou art but of low degree;
’Tis pride that pulls the country down;
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.
 Some wine, ho!
Cassio: ’Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
Iago: Will you hear’t again?
Cassio: No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things. Well, God’s above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
Iago: It’s true, good lieutenant.
Cassio: For mine own part – no offence to the general, nor any man of quality – I hope to be saved.
Iago: And so do I too, lieutenant.
Cassio: Ay, but by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let’s have no more of this; let’s to our affairs. God forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk; this is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left hand. I am not drunk now, I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.
All: Excellent well.
Cassio: Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.

Gwendolen: Mr Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends on your reply.

Algernon: In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.
Cecily [to GWENDOLEN]: That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?
Gwendolen: Yes, dear, if you can believe him.
Cecily: I don’t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.
Gwendolen: True. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing. Mr Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for pretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?
Jack: Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?
Gwendolen: I have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intend to crush them. This is not the moment for German scepticism. [Moving to CECILY] Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr Worthing’s. That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.
Cecily: I am more than content with what Mr Moncrieff said. His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
Gwendolen: Then you think we should forgive them?
Cecily: Yes. I mean no.
Gwendolen: True! I had forgotten. There are principles at stake that one cannot surrender. Which of us should tell them? The task is not a pleasant one.
Cecily: Could we not both speak at the same time?
Gwendolen: An excellent idea! I nearly always speak at the same time as other people. Will you take the time from me?
Cecily: Certainly. [GWENDOLEN beats time with uplifted finger]
Gwendolen and Cecily [speaking together]: Your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier. That is all!
Jack and Algernon [speaking together]: Our Christian names! Is that all? But we are going to be christened this afternoon.
