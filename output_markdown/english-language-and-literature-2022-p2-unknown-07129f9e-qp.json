It must be a comedy.\nMary: ‘My desire of being punctual in my obedience requires that you would be plain in your commands, Sir.’\nDabby: Well said, Mary, well said.\nRalph: I think that’s enough. You read very well, Brenham. Would you also be able to copy the play? We have only two copies.\nDabby: Course she will. Where do I come in, Lieutenant? The cousin.\nRalph: Can you read, Bryant?\nDabby: Not those marks in the books, Lieutenant, but I can read other things. I read dreams very well, Lieutenant. Very well.\nRalph: I don’t think you’re right for Melinda. I’m thinking of someone else. And if you can’t read …\nDabby: Mary will read me the lines, Lieutenant.\nRalph: There’s Rose …\nDabby: Rose. I like the name. I’ll be Rose. Who is she?\nRalph: She’s a country girl …\nDabby: I grew up in Devon, Lieutenant. I’m perfect for Rose. What does she do?\nRalph: She – well, it’s complicated. She falls in love with Silvia.\n[MARY begins to giggle but tries to hold it back.]\n But it’s because she thinks Silvia’s a man. And she – they – she sleeps with her. Rose. With Silvia. Euh. Silvia too. With Rose. But nothing happens.\nDabby: It doesn’t? Nothing?\n[DABBY bursts out laughing.]",

And don’t go in the back room. The floor’s up. Mind how you go.\n[MARKY heads inside.]\n Excuse the mess. We’re just giving Lee Piper a send-off. He’s off to Australia tomorrow. You know Lee. Good lad. He ain’t never even been abroad before, so we’re just sending him on his way.\nDawn: What the hell are you doing, John?\nJohnny: What?\nDawn: ‘What’?\nJohnny: What?\nDawn: Okay. Sure. We can do this. ‘What?’ I’ll tell you what.\n[Beat.]\nJohnny: Oh, that.\nDawn: ‘Oh, that,’ Yes, John. ‘That.’ You know how I know? Marky told me. His mate Dashiell told him. At school. Dashiell’s dad’s in the South Wiltshire, and he’s at a barbecue Sunday, laughing about it with a bunch of the other dads. Everyone at the school gate knows. All the other mums. All the kids. But I call you yesterday, three in the afternoon, you’re in the pub. ‘Sure, no problem, tomorrow’s fine. I’ll take Marky up the fair.’\nJohnny: Dawn –\nDawn: I get here and you’re sitting around, getting pissed with a bunch of kids. The police are coming. They’re going to bulldoze this place. You’re having a party.\nJohnny: It’s a storm in a teacup.\nDawn: Of course. Of course it is. Marky comes home every day in floods. Scratches. Bruises. His bag-handle torn. ‘Your dad don’t pay no tax. Your dad’s a gyppo. He’s going to prison.’ ‘Not my dad, Mum. My dad’s great. My dad’s the best.’ ‘He is, Marky. He’s amazing. He’s a one-off. He can’t even take his own boy up the fair. Can’t keep a promise to a six-year-old child.’ Question: Do you have drugs in there? Where your son is.\nJohnny: Dawn –\nDawn: Because when the police get here, tomorrow morning, what are they going to find? Because Marky needs that next. You in prison for ten fucking years. Marky need that like a bag on his head.\nJohnny: Marky ain’t got nothing to worry about. That boy’s gonna be just fine.\nDawn: Really. That’s a relief. Because, this time Monday, at school. After the South Wiltshire have turned you inside out. Fucking bulldozed this to the ground and you’re set in some cell. Then, Marky’s got nothing to worry about. Do you have drugs in there, John?\nJohnny: Dawn –\nDawn: Do you –\nJohnny: Dawn –\nDawn: Answer me. Do you have drugs in there –\nJohnny: You know I fucking do. Why? You want some?\nDawn: Fuck off.\nJohnny: Dawn –\nDawn: Fuck off. All right? Fuck off. Like I’m in the wrong here. Like this is my fault. My problem. Fuck off.\nJohnny: Look, Dawn, relax. Sit down, have a drink. It’s nothing to worry about.\nDawn: Good. Excellent. Well, let’s have a drink then. It’s Fair Day. [Beat.] What happened, Johnny? The world turns. And it turns. And it moves on and you don’t. You’re still here.\nJohnny: You know what they say, Dawn. If it ain’t broke. \nDawn: It is broke. It’s broke. Like a stopped fucking clock. [Shows him her watch.] Wake up. Because when it gets to there – look at it. Look at it – when it get to there, Johnny –\nJohnny: You leave all of that to me.",
