## QUESTION 1: Section 1 – Shakespeare: Coriolanus

*Answer one question, both parts (a) and (b), from this section. You should spend about 1 hour and 15 minutes on this section. Answer both parts (a) and (b).*

### Question 1(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

Rome. A street. 
Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons. 
1 CITIZEN Before we proceed any further, hear me speak. 
ALL Speak, speak. 
1 CITIZEN You are all resolv’d rather to die than to famish? 
ALL Resolv’d, resolv’d. 
1 CITIZEN First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people. 
ALL We know’t, we know’t. 
1 CITIZEN Let us kill him, and we’ll have corn at our own price. Is’t a verdict? 
ALL No more talking on’t; let it be done. Away, away! 
2 CITIZEN One word, good citizens. 
1 CITIZEN We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. What authority surfeits on would relieve us; if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely; but they think we are too dear. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge. 
2 CITIZEN Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius? 
1 CITIZEN Against him first; he’s a very dog to the commonalty.
2 CITIZEN Consider you what services he has done for his country? 
1 CITIZEN Very well, and could be content to give him good report for’t but that he pays himself with being proud. 
2 CITIZEN Nay, but speak not maliciously. 
1 CITIZEN I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it to that end; though soft-conscienc’d men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue. 
2 CITIZEN What he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous. 
1 CITIZEN If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations; he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition. [Shouts within] What shouts are these? The other side o’ th’ city is risen. Why stay we prating here? To th’ Capitol! 
ALL Come, come. 
1 CITIZEN Soft! who comes here? 
Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA. 
2 CITIZEN Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lov’d the people. 
1 CITIZEN He’s one honest enough; would all the rest were so! 
MENENIUS What work’s, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you 
With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you. 
1 CITIZEN Our business is not unknown to th’ Senate; they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we’ll show ’em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths; they shall know we have strong arms too. 
MENENIUS Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours, 
Will you undo yourselves?

## QUESTION 2: Section 1 – Shakespeare: Hamlet

*Answer both parts (a) and (b).*

### Question 2(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

Enter POLONIUS. 
LAERTES I stay too long. But here my father comes. 
A double blessing is a double grace; 
Occasion smiles upon a second leave. 
POLONIUS Yet here, Laertes! Aboard, aboard, for shame! 
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, 
And you are stay’d for. There – my blessing with thee! 
And these few precepts in thy memory 
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, 
Nor any unproportion’d thought his act. 
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. 
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, 
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; 
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment 
Of each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d courage. Beware 
Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in, 
Bear’t that th’ opposed may beware of thee. 
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; 
Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment. 
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, 
But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy; 
For the apparel oft proclaims the man; 
And they in France of the best rank and station 
Are of a most select and generous choice in that. 
Neither a borrower nor a lender be; 
For loan oft loses both itself and friend, 
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. 
This above all – to thine own self be true, 
And it must follow, as the night the day, 
Thou canst not then be false to any man. 
Farewell; my blessing season this in thee! 
LAERTES Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord. 
POLONIUS The time invites you; go, your servants tend. 
LAERTES Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well 
What I have said to you. 
OPHELIA ’Tis in my memory lock’d, 
And you yourself shall keep the key of it. 
LAERTES Farewell. [Exit. 
POLONIUS What is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you? 
OPHELIA So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. 
POLONIUS Marry, well bethought! 
’Tis told me he hath very oft of late 
Given private time to you; and you yourself 
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous. 
If it be so – as so ’tis put on me, 
And that in way of caution – I must tell you 
You do not understand yourself so clearly 
As it behoves my daughter and your honour. 
What is between you? Give me up the truth. 
OPHELIA He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders 
Of his affection to me. 
POLONIUS Affection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl, 
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. 
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them? 
OPHELIA I do not know, my lord, what I should think. 
POLONIUS Marry, I will teach you: think yourself a baby 
That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay 
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly; 
Or – not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, 
Running it thus – you’ll tender me a fool. 
OPHELIA My lord, he hath importun’d me with love 
In honourable fashion. 
POLONIUS Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to. 
OPHELIA And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, 
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

## QUESTION 3: Section 1 – Shakespeare: Measure for Measure

*Answer both parts (a) and (b).*

### Question 3(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

LUCIO What news, friar, of the Duke? 
DUKE I know none. Can you tell me of any? 
LUCIO Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is in Rome; but where is he, think you? 
DUKE I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well. 
LUCIO It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to’t. 
DUKE He does well in’t. 
LUCIO A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him. Something too crabbed that way, friar. 
DUKE It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it. 
LUCIO Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it true, think you? 
DUKE How should he be made, then? 
LUCIO Some report a sea-maid spawn’d him; some, that he was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congeal’d ice; that I know to be true. And he is a motion generative; that’s infallible. 
DUKE You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace. 
LUCIO Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that is absent have done this? Ere he would have hang’d a man for the getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand. He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy. 
DUKE I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was not inclin’d that way. 
LUCIO O, sir, you are deceiv’d. 
DUKE ’Tis not possible. 
LUCIO Who – not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too; that let me inform you. 
DUKE You do him wrong, surely. 
LUCIO Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing. 
DUKE What, I prithee, might be the cause? 
LUCIO No, pardon; ’tis a secret must be lock’d within the teeth and the lips; but this I can let you understand: the greater file of the subject held the Duke to be wise. 
DUKE Wise? Why, no question but he was. 
LUCIO A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow. 
DUKE Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking; the very stream of his life, and the business he hath helmed, must, upon a warranted need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskilfully; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much dark’ned in your malice. 
LUCIO Sir, I know him, and I love him.

*Answer both parts (a) and (b).*

### Question 4(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops. CATESBY returns. 
MAYOR See where his Grace stands ’tween two clergymen! 
BUCKINGHAM Two props of virtue for a Christian prince, 
To stay him from the fall of vanity; 
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand, 
True ornaments to know a holy man. 
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince, 
Lend favourable ear to our requests, 
And pardon us the interruption 
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal. 
GLOUCESTER My lord, there needs no such apology: 
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, 
Who, earnest in the service of my God, 
Deferr’d the visitation of my friends. 
But, leaving this, what is your Grace’s pleasure? 
BUCKINGHAM Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above, 
And all good men of this ungovern’d isle. 
GLOUCESTER I do suspect I have done some offence 
That seems disgracious in the city’s eye, 
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance. 
BUCKINGHAM You have, my lord. Would it might please your Grace, 
On our entreaties, to amend your fault! 
GLOUCESTER Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land? 
BUCKINGHAM Know then, it is your fault that you resign 
The supreme seat, the throne majestical, 
The scept’red office of your ancestors, 
Your state of fortune and your due of birth, 
The lineal glory of your royal house, 
To the corruption of a blemish’d stock; 
Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, 
Which here we waken to our country’s good, 
The noble isle doth want her proper limbs; 
Her face defac’d with scars of infamy, 
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants, 
And almost should’red in the swallowing gulf 
Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion. 
Which to recure, we heartily solicit 
Your gracious self to take on you the charge 
And kingly government of this your land – 
Not as protector, steward, substitute, 
Or lowly factor for another’s gain; 
But as successively, from blood to blood, 
Your right of birth, your empery, your own. 
For this, consorted with the citizens, 
Your very worshipful and loving friends, 
And by their vehement instigation, 
In this just cause come I to move your Grace. 
GLOUCESTER I cannot tell if to depart in silence 
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof 
Best fitteth my degree or your condition. 
If not to answer, you might haply think 
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded 
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, 
Which fondly you would here impose on me; 
If to reprove you for this suit of yours, 
So season’d with your faithful love to me, 
Then, on the other side, I check’d my friends. 
Therefore – to speak, and to avoid the first, 
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last – 
Definitively thus I answer you: 
Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert 
Unmeritable shuns your high request.

## QUESTION 5: Section 1 – Shakespeare: The Tempest

*Answer both parts (a) and (b).*

### Question 5(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

PROSPERO This King of Naples, being an enemy 
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit; 
Which was, that he, in lieu o’ th’ premises. 
Of homage, and I know not how much tribute. 
Should presently extirpate me and mine 
Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan 
With all the honours on my brother. Whereon, 
A treacherous army levied, one midnight 
Fated to th’ purpose, did Antonio open 
The gates of Milan; and, i’ th’ dead of darkness, 
The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence 
Me and thy crying self. 
MIRANDA Alack, for pity! 
I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then. 
Will cry it o’er again; it is a hint 
That wrings mine eyes to’t. 
PROSPERO Hear a little further, 
And then I’ll bring thee to the present business 
Which now’s upon ’s: without the which this story 
Were most impertinent. 
MIRANDA Wherefore did they not 
That hour destroy us? 
PROSPERO Well demanded, wench! 
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, 
So dear the love my people bore me; nor set 
A mark so bloody on the business; but 
With colours fairer painted their foul ends. 
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark; 
Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared 
A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg’d, 
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats 
Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us. 
To cry to th’ sea, that roar’d to us; to sigh 
To th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again, 
Did us but loving wrong. 
MIRANDA Alack, what trouble 
Was I then to you! 
PROSPERO O, a cherubin 
Thou wast that did preserve me! Thou didst smile. 
Infused with a fortitude from heaven, 
When I have deck’d the sea with drops full salt, 
Under my burden groan’d; which rais’d in me 
An undergoing stomach, to bear up 
Against what should ensue. 
MIRANDA How came we ashore? 
PROSPERO By Providence divine. 
Some food we had and some fresh water that 
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, 
Out of his charity, who being then appointed 
Master of this design, did give us, with 
Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries. 
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness. 
Knowing I lov’d my books, he furnish’d me 
From mine own library with volumes that 
I prize above my dukedom. 
MIRANDA Would I might 
But ever see that man! 
PROSPERO Now I arise. 
[Puts on his mantle. 
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. 
Here in this island we arriv’d; and here 
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit 
Than other princess’ can, that have more time 
For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful. 
MIRANDA Heavens thank you for’t! And now, I pray you, sir, 
For still ’tis beating in my mind, your reason 
For raising this sea-storm? 
PROSPERO Know thus far forth: 
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, 
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies 
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience 
I find my zenith doth depend upon 
A most auspicious star, whose influence 
If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes 
Will ever after droop.

### Question 6(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

Enter Officers. 
FABIAN O good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers. 
SIR TOBY [To Antonio] I’ll be with you anon. 
VIOLA Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please. 
SIR ANDREW Marry, will I, sir; and for that I promis’d you, I’ll be as good as my word. He will bear you easily and reins well. 
1 OFFICER This is the man; do thy office. 
2 OFFICER Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit 
Of Count Orsino. 
ANTONIO You do mistake me, sir. 
1 OFFICER No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well, 
Though now you have no sea-cap on your head. 
Take him away; he knows I know him well. 
ANTONIO I must obey. [To Viola] This comes with seeking you; 
But there’s no remedy; I shall answer it. 
What will you do, now my necessity 
Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me 
Much more for what I cannot do for you 
Than what befalls myself. You stand amaz’d; 
But be of comfort. 
2 OFFICER Come, sir, away. 
ANTONIO I must entreat of you some of that money. 
VIOLA What money, sir? 
For the fair kindness you have show’d me here, 
And part being prompted by your present trouble, 
Out of my lean and low ability 
I’ll lend you something. My having is not much; 
I’ll make division of my present with you; 
Hold, there’s half my coffer. 
ANTONIO Will you deny me now? 
Is’t possible that my deserts to you 
Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery, 
Lest that it make me so unsound a man 
As to upbraid you with those kindnesses 
That I have done for you. 
VIOLA I know of none, 
Nor know I you by voice or any feature. 
I hate ingratitude more in a man 
Than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness, 
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption 
Inhabits our frail blood. 
ANTONIO O heavens themselves! 
2 OFFICER Come, sir, I pray you go. 
ANTONIO Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here 
I snatch’d one half out of the jaws of death, 
Reliev’d him with such sanctity of love, 
And to his image, which methought did promise 
Most venerable worth, did I devotion. 
1 OFFICER What’s that to us? The time goes by; away. 
ANTONIO But, O, how vile an idol proves this god! 
Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame. 
In nature there’s no blemish but the mind: 
None can be call’d deform’d but the unkind. 
Virtue is beauty; but the beauteous evil 
Are empty trunks, o’erflourish’d by the devil. 
1 OFFICER The man grows mad. Away with him. 
Come, come, sir. 
ANTONIO Lead me on. [Exit with Officers.
