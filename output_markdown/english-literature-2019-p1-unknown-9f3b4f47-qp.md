## QUESTION 1: Section 1 – Shakespeare: Coriolanus

*Answer one question, both parts (a) and (b), from this section. You should spend about 1 hour and 15 minutes on this section.
Answer both parts (a) and (b).*

### Question 1(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servant.
AUFIDIUS Where is this fellow?
2 SERVANT Here, sir; I’d have beaten him like a dog, but for disturbing the lords within.
AUFIDIUS Whence com’st thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name?
Why speak’st not? Speak, man. What’s thy name?
CORIOLANUS [Unmuffling] If, Tullus,
Not yet thou know’st me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Commands me name myself.
AUFIDIUS What is thy name?
CORIOLANUS A name unmusical to the Volscians’ ears,
And harsh in sound to thine.
AUFIDIUS Say, what’s thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
Bears a command in’t; though thy tackle’s torn,
Thou show’st a noble vessel. What’s thy name?
CORIOLANUS Prepare thy brow to frown – know’st thou me yet?
AUFIDIUS I know thee not. Thy name?
CORIOLANUS My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces,
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus. The painful service,
The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country, are requited
But with that surname – a good memory
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour’d the rest,
And suffer’d me by th’ voice of slaves to be
Whoop’d out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope,
Mistake me not, to save my life; for if
I had fear’d death, of all the men i’ th’ world
I would have ’voided thee; but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight
And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee; for I will fight
Against my cank’red country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou dar’st not this, and that to prove more fortunes
Th’art tir’d, then, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever followed thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country’s breast,
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.
AUFIDIUS O Marcius, Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy.

## QUESTION 2: Section 1 – Shakespeare: Hamlet

*Answer both parts (a) and (b).*

### Question 2(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

1 CLOWN What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
2 CLOWN The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
1 CLOWN I like thy wit well; in good faith the gallows does well; but how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To ’t again, come.
2 CLOWN Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?
1 CLOWN Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
2 CLOWN Marry, now I can tell.
1 CLOWN To ’t.
2 CLOWN Mass, I cannot tell.
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, afar off.
1 CLOWN Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask’d this question next, say ‘a grave-maker’: the houses he makes lasts till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor. [Exit Second Clown.
[Digs and sings] In youth, when I did love, did love,
Methought it was very sweet,
To contract-o-the time for-a my behove,
O, methought there-a-was nothing-a meet.
HAMLET Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that ’a sings in grave-making?
HORATIO Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
HAMLET ’Tis e’en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.
1 CLOWN [Sings] But age, with his stealing steps,
Hath clawed me in his clutch,
And hath shipped me intil the land,
As if I had never been such.
[Throws up a skull.
HAMLET That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls it to the ground, as if ’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o’erreaches; one that would circumvent God, might it not?
HORATIO It might, my lord.
HAMLET Or of a courtier; which could say ‘Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, sweet lord?’ This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that praised my Lord Such-a-one’s horse, when ’a meant to beg it ‒ might it not?
HORATIO Ay, my lord.
HAMLET Why, e’en so; and now my Lady Worm’s, chapless, and knock’d about the mazard with a sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had the trick to see’t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggats with them? Mine ache to think on’t.

## QUESTION 3: Section 1 – Shakespeare: Measure for Measure

*Answer both parts (a) and (b).*

### Question 3(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

Enter ISABELLA.
ISABELLA My business is a word or two with Claudio.
PROVOST And very welcome. Look, signior, here’s your sister.
DUKE Provost, a word with you.
PROVOST As many as you please.
DUKE Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be conceal’d.
[Exeunt Duke and Provost.
CLAUDIO Now, sister, what’s the comfort?
ISABELLA Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good, indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger.
Therefore, your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set on.
CLAUDIO Is there no remedy?
ISABELLA None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain.
CLAUDIO But is there any?
ISABELLA Yes, brother, you may live:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you’ll implore it, that will free your life,
But fetter you till death.
CLAUDIO Perpetual durance?
ISABELLA Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though all the world’s vastidity you had,
To a determin’d scope.
CLAUDIO But in what nature?
ISABELLA In such a one as, you consenting to’t,
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
And leave you naked.
CLAUDIO Let me know the point.
ISABELLA O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Dar’st thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle that we tread upon
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.
CLAUDIO Why give you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flow’ry tenderness? If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride
And hug it in mine arms.
ISABELLA There spake my brother; there my father’s grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i’ th’ head, and follies doth enew
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.
CLAUDIO The precise Angelo!
ISABELLA O, ’tis the cunning livery of hell
The damned’st body to invest and cover
In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,
If I would yield him my virginity
Thou mightst be freed?
CLAUDIO O heavens! it cannot be.
ISABELLA Yes, he would give’t thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night’s the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest to-morrow.
CLAUDIO Thou shalt not do’t.
ISABELLA O, were it but my life!
I’d throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin.
CLAUDIO Thanks, dear Isabel.

## QUESTION 4: Section 1 – Shakespeare: Richard III

*Answer both parts (a) and (b).*

### Question 4(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

Enter the Ghost of HASTINGS.
GHOST [To Richard] Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,
And in a bloody battle end thy days!
Think on Lord Hastings. Despair and die.
[To Richmond] Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England’s sake!
Enter the Ghosts of the two young Princes.
GHOSTS [To Richard] Dream on thy cousins smothered in the Tower.
Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,
And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
Thy nephews’ souls bid thee despair and die.
[To Richmond] Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and wake in joy;
Good angels guard thee from the boar’s annoy!
Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.
Enter the Ghost of LADY ANNE, his wife.
GHOST [To Richard] Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife
That never slept a quiet hour with thee
Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.
To-morrow in the battle think on me,
And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die.
[To Richmond] Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep;
Dream of success and happy victory.
Thy adversary’s wife doth pray for thee.
Enter the Ghost of BUCKINGHAM.
GHOST [To Richard] The first was I that help’d thee to the crown;
The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
O, in the battle think on Buckingham,
And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
Dream on, dream on of bloody deeds and death;
Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
[To Richmond] I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid;
But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismay’d:
God and good angels fight on Richmond’s side;
And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
[The Ghosts vanish. Richard starts out of his dream.
KING RICHARD Give me another horse. Bind up my wounds.
Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What do I fear? Myself? There’s none else by.
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
Is there a murderer here? No ‒ yes, I am.
Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why ‒
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself!
Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good.
That I myself have done unto myself?
O, no! Alas, I rather hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
I am a villain; yet I lie, I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well. Fool, do not flatter.
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
Perjury, perjury, in the high’st degree;
Murder, stern murder, in the dir’st degree;
All several sins, all us’d in each degree,
Throng to the bar, crying all ‘Guilty! guilty!’
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
And if I die no soul will pity me:
And wherefore should they, since that I myself
Find myself no pity to myself?
Methought the souls of all that I had murder’d
Came to my tent, and every one did threat
To-morrow’s vengeance on the head of Richard.

## QUESTION 5: Section 1 – Shakespeare: The Tempest

*Answer both parts (a) and (b).*

### Question 5(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

SEBASTIAN Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,
Who hath cause to wet the grief on’t.
ALONSO Prithee, peace.
SEBASTIAN You were kneel’d to, and importun’d otherwise
By all of us; and the fair soul herself
Weigh’d between loathness and obedience at
Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son,
I fear, for ever. Milan and Naples have
Moe widows in them of this business’ making,
Than we bring men to comfort them;
The fault’s your own.
ALONSO So is the dear’st o’ th’ loss.
GONZALO My lord Sebastian,
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,
And time to speak it in; you rub the sore,
When you should bring the plaster.
SEBASTIAN Very well.
ANTONIO And most chirurgeonly.
GONZALO It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.
SEBASTIAN Fowl weather?
ANTONIO Very foul.
GONZALO Had I plantation of this isle, my lord –
ANTONIO He’d sow ’t with nettle-seed.
SEBASTIAN Or docks, or mallows.
GONZALO And were the king on’t, what would I do?
SEBASTIAN Scape being drunk for want of wine.
GONZALO I’ th’ commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty –
SEBASTIAN Yet he would be king on’t.
ANTONIO The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.
GONZALO All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour. Treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of it own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.
SEBASTIAN No marrying ’mong his subjects?
ANTONIO None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.
GONZALO I would with such perfection govern, sir,
T’ excel the golden age.
SEBASTIAN Save his Majesty!
ANTONIO Long live Gonzalo!

### Question 6(a) [15 marks]

<details><summary>Scenario / Source Text</summary>

The Duke’s palace.
Enter VALENTINE, and VIOLA in a man’s attire.
VALENTINE If the Duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanc’d; he hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
VIOLA You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?
VALENTINE No, believe me.
Enter DUKE, CURIO, and Attendants.
VIOLA I thank you. Here comes the Count.
DUKE Who saw Cesario, ho?
VIOLA On your attendance, my lord, here.
DUKE Stand you awhile aloof. Cesario,
Thou know’st no less but all; I have unclasp’d
To thee the book even of my secret soul.
Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
And tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow
Till thou have audience.
VIOLA Sure, my noble lord,
If she be so abandon’d to her sorrow
As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
DUKE Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds,
Rather than make unprofited return.
VIOLA Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
DUKE O, then unfold the passion of my love,
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith! It shall become thee well to act my woes: She will attend it better in thy youth Than in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect.
VIOLA I think not so, my lord.
DUKE Dear lad, believe it;
For they shall yet belie thy happy years
That say thou art a man; Diana’s lip
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
Is as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound,
And all is semblative a woman’s part.
I know thy constellation is right apt
For this affair. Some four or five attend him ‒
All, if you will, for I myself am best
When least in company. Prosper well in this,
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord
To call his fortunes thine.
VIOLA I’ll do my best
To woo your lady. [Aside] Yet, a barful strife!
Whoe’er I woo, myself would be his wife.
