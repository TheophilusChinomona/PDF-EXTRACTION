## SECTION B

### Question 1 [20 marks] (Application Analysis)

**Child Language Development Analysis - Text A**

> **Marker instruction:** Decide on a mark for AO1 out of 10, and then a separate mark for AO2 out of 10. Add the two marks together to reach a total out of 20 marks. Allocate the mark according to the level of competency demonstrated for each AO individually.

- Beth uses labelling correctly 'froggie', albeit in a diminutive form.
- Natasha responds to Danielle’s suggestions and builds on them. Charlie copies her.
- Both children seem to enjoy playing with language and sound within the context of sending a message while wearing frog masks.
- Element of performance.
- Phonology: There is gliding/substitution from Charlie ‘/fw ɒg/’.
- Phonology: Rhyming and repetition of ‘frog’ with a range of words/sounds initiated by Natasha and copied by Charlie.
- Phonology: Natasha uses largely standard pronunciation; Charlie follows her lead and copies.
- Grammar: Natasha uses subject and object pronouns correctly ‘do you miss me’; Charlie copies her.
- Grammar: Syntactic parallelism used by Natasha: first person pronoun + verb, e.g. ‘I like froggie’.
- Grammar: All of the children’s utterances are in the present tense.
- Grammar: Use of concrete nouns – ‘froggie’, ‘logger’ [log], – reflecting topic/activity.
- Grammar: Natasha sometimes omits auxiliary verbs ‘I little froggie cola’, but not always ‘I’m a little froggie’.
- Grammar: Natasha uses standard syntax (e.g. subject-verb-object) appropriately ‘I like going on a loggy’.
- Grammar: Natasha makes use of an interrogative, ‘do you miss me’, and declaratives, ‘I’m a little frog’.
- Grammar: Use of ‘froggie’ as an adjective (‘froggie things’) as well as a noun.
- Concepts: The mother’s interaction provides scaffolding (Bruner) and modelling (Skinner).
- Concepts: Natasha creates neologisms, for example, ‘froggagola’.
- Concepts: Mother uses imperative and interrogative functions to provide scaffolding.
- Concepts: Naming words represent 60% of children's early word production (Nelson).
- Concepts: Capacity for imaginative play suggests cognitive development (Piaget) and imaginative function of language (Halliday).
- Concepts: Mention of Vygotsky’s ZPD – Danielle encouraging children to extend/adapt speech to message format.

### Question 2 [24 marks] (Application Analysis)

**Language, Power and Gender Analysis - Text B**

> **Marker instruction:** Decide on a mark for AO2 out of 12, and then a separate mark for AO3 out of 12. Add the two marks together to reach a total out of 24 marks.

- Goodman – informalisation features in the online article context.
- Representation of (female) professor as successful disarms gender stereotypes (Pilkington).
- Cameron – assumptions in education regarding females better suited to biology/medicine over physics.
- Graphological features typical of genre (e.g., social media links).
- Lexical fields of science and study: ‘heat-resistance experiment’, ‘A-level’, ‘experimental physics’.
- Latinate/sophisticated lexical choices reflect broadsheet context (The Guardian).
- Use of proper nouns/names to establish credibility/influential power (Fairclough), e.g., Athene Donald.
- Use of numbers/statistics connotes instrumental power of auditing organisations.
- Metaphor ‘champion’ for female physics professor suggests context of an ongoing battle.
- Noun phrases in apposition for naming participants: ‘Alice, a sixth-former at Lampton School’.
- Pragmatics: Positioning in relation to clichéd expectations (Twilight, boy bands) is unclear/ironic.
- Pragmatics: Focus on asymmetry in subject choices and encouraging females into science.
- Pragmatics: Idiomatic reference to ‘a bit of stick’ as a euphemism for resistance girls face in physics.
- Pragmatics: Use of Lampton School as a specific example to address asymmetry.
- Semantic field of deterioration: ‘risk’, ‘slip’, ‘problem’.

## SECTION C

### Question 3

**Topic:** Language Change: 19th vs 21st Century Volcano Reports (Text C and Text D)

*Lexis and Semantics*

*Grammar and Morphology*

*Discourse and Pragmatics*

**Conclusion:**
- Comparison of the sense of individual writer (Text C) vs neutral historical view (Text D).
- Analysis of how language has varied over time from 1868 to 2018 in terms of complexity and formality.
