          "scenario": "TEXT A\n\nTHE POWER OF STORYTELLING\n\n1 Storytelling is an ancient art form that has been used for centuries to convey messages, share experiences and connect with others. From oral traditions to written texts, stories have the power to inspire, educate and entertain people.\n\n2 There is little that can match good storytelling for strongly connecting and influencing us to make decisions. Sharing stories bonds us to each other, strengthens our relationships, our communities and the world around us. Stories help us to build bridges between different cultures. Through storytelling, cultural traditions, values and beliefs are shared, thereby promoting cross-cultural understanding. In addition, stories also entertain and offer an escape from reality.\n\n3 The reason good stories have such a strong influence on humans is that they directly impact emotions. Humans are emotional beings, even though they tend to believe that they are rational beings. Research has shown that people often make emotional decisions before their rational minds do, even if they are unaware of it. While individuals may believe that they make decisions using their rational brain, they often make them based on emotions. When listening to a story, more of the brain is engaged than when we are simply presented with data. Stories can turn abstract concepts into relatable and interesting content, maintaining interest and focus.\n\n4 'Data does not change human behaviour, but emotions do. Storytelling dynamically engages emotions and increases trust in the storyteller,' writes Karen Eber in The Perfect Story: How to Tell Stories that Inform, Influence and Inspire. Stories can evoke emotions and create a deep emotional bond between the storyteller and the audience. As people listen to stories, they gain empathy for the storytellers, particularly when the storytellers openly display their emotions for everyone to see and possibly criticise as they share their experiences. This emotional engagement with the storyteller makes the message more meaningful and memorable.\n\n5 Storytelling can be used to motivate and stir people to take action. Many great speakers have discovered that telling stories has a much greater influence on their audiences than simply giving out information. When people tell us a story, we automatically try to put ourselves in their place, imagining what it is like for them. We can imagine their fear, sadness, disappointment as well as share in their hope, joy and happiness. For this reason, messages received from stories are more meaningful than those received from other sources. Stories have the power to increase our levels of empathy.\n\n6 The power of storytelling does not diminish; it remains important in the workplace and in human lives. Harvey Deutschendorf, an expert on emotional behaviour, argues that storytelling is not just fun; it is also an incredibly efficient and intelligent way to get ahead at work. Organisations and leaders can use stories to create bonds, motivate teams and establish a sense of community and belonging for employees.\n\n7 The need for social interaction, relationships and forming bonds is part of who we are. Many of us fear that we will lose the connection with each other due to the sharp rise in the use of technology which impacts on face-to-face communication and relationships. It is crucial that we use proven methods that can strengthen and enhance our emotional ties to one another in this time of change. Storytelling remains a vital tool for communication, personal growth and professional success.\n\n8 Storytelling is a powerful tool that has the ability to transform individuals and communities. By controlling the power of storytelling, we can connect with others, share our experiences and create meaningful relationships. Whether in personal or professional settings, storytelling is an essential skill that can help us in many ways and make a lasting impact.",

The care you give yourself can improve your mood and relationships. There are various things you can do to practise self-care.\n\nHumans are social beings who need to connect with others and spend time with friends and family. Visiting friends and spending time with loved ones can be good for your mental health.\n\nIt is important to eat food that nourishes your body. Having a balanced diet with a variety of healthy food can keep your blood sugar stable, help you to maintain a healthy weight and improve your mood.\n\nDaily exercises that increase your heart rate are good for your body and mind. Moving your body is what is important. You could go to the gym, join an exercise class or go out in nature and take a walk.\n\nAnother way to practise self-care is to have a clear mind. Your attention and focus should be on the present moment. Broaden your general knowledge. Exposure to new information can be exciting and it also decreases boredom and overthinking. To care for yourself effectively, you need to spend some time every day focusing on yourself. Engage in various restful activities, like reading and meditation. Get good quality sleep as the benefits of a good night's sleep are well documented. A lack of quality sleep can negatively affect your health.\n\nWhen you feel well cared for, it is easier to support and care for others.",

It also celebrates iconic moments of the Webb Ellis Cup tour.\n\n3 The bundle is inspired by Eben Etzebeth, known as ꞌElizabediꞌ. Eben had KFC delivered to the Springboks' tour bus. The moment was captured by fans of the team. The order was the inspiration behind the 'Elizabedi' Bundle, an exclusive meal for R44,44 in honour of the No. 4 jersey.\n\n4 This is not the first time Etzebeth has shared special moments with a KFC meal. In 2013 the champion received KFC from Stormers' stalwart Scarra Ntubeni.\n\n5 Grant Macpherson said, 'We understand the need for Etzebeth to kick off an important event with South Africa's most loved chicken.' It is an ideal solution for a champion on tour.\n\n[Adapted from www.timeslive.co.za]",
